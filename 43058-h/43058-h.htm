PREFATORY NOTE
</h2>

<p>
On the morning of September 3rd, 1907, Count
Paul Kamarowsky, a wealthy Russian nobleman,
was fatally shot in his apartments on the Lido in
Venice by an intimate friend, Nicolas Naumoff,
son of the governor of Orel. The crime was at
first believed to be political. The wounded man
refused to make any statement against his assailant,
whom he himself had assisted to escape from
the balcony to a gondola in waiting below.
</p>

<p>
Count Kamarowsky was taken to a hospital, and
for three days his recovery seemed assured; but
the chief surgeon, in a sudden mental collapse—he
has since died in an insane asylum—ordered
the stitches to be removed from the fast-healing
wounds, and Count Kamarowsky died in great
agony a few hours later. His last words were a
message of love to his betrothed at Kieff, a beautiful
Russian woman, Countess Marie Tarnowska.
</p>

<p>
In her favor Count Kamarowsky had, shortly
before his death, made a will and also insured his
life for the sum of £20,000.
</p>

<p>
A number of telegrams from this lady were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
found addressed to a Russian lawyer, Donat
Prilukoff, who had been staying at the Hotel
Danieli in Venice until the day of the murder.
Both this man and the Countess Tarnowska were
arrested.
</p>

<p>
After a sensational trial they were found guilty
of instigating the young Nicolas Naumoff to
commit the murder. Countess Tarnowska was
sentenced to eight years' imprisonment in the
penitentiary of Trani; Prilukoff was condemned
to ten years' penal servitude; while Naumoff himself
was liberated in view of his having undergone
two years' incarceration while awaiting his trial.

TO THE AUTHOR
</h2>

<p>
<i>Signora:</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Not only as the medical expert for the defense at
the trial of the Countess Tarnowska, but as one
who has made it his life-work to investigate the
relation in women between criminal impulse and
morbid physical condition, I cannot but feel the
keenest interest in this book, in which you set forth
the problem of wide human interest presented by
the case of the prisoner of Trani.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>When first I suggested to you that you should
write this book—which (apart from its interest as
dealing with a</i> cause célèbre <i>whose protagonists
are still living and well known in European society)
might bring into wider knowledge doctrines
that modern physiologists and psychologists are
endeavoring to diffuse—you reminded me that the
medical elements of the problem could not in such
a work be discussed or even clearly stated. This,
of course, is true, and the significance of certain
indications scattered through these pages will
doubtless be lost upon those who are not familiar
with such matters. Nevertheless, it was important
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
that the book should be written, for if after her
release and appropriate medical treatment the
Countess Tarnowska is restored, as many of us
confidently anticipate, to the complete sanity of
moral well-being, your book in the light of that essential
fact will have fulfilled a notable mission.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>It will have helped to bring home to the general
consciousness the knowledge, hitherto confined to
the scientific few, that moral obliquity in women is
in most cases due to pathological causes comparatively
easy of diagnosis and of cure; that a woman-criminal
may be morally redeemed by being
physically healed; and that just as alcoholism,
typhus, pyemia or other modes of toxic infection
may result in delirium and irresponsibility, so certain
forms of disease in women, by setting up a
condition of persistent organic poisoning, may and
very often do conduce to mental and moral aberration
and consequent crime.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Your book, Signora, contains a truthful exposition
of a group of psychic values with which physicians
and psychopathists are concerned, and I
believe that eventually it will promote the realization
that even in the darkest regions of moral
degradation it is possible for science to raise the
torch of hope. Thus, though appealing for the
moment to the interest of the general reader, it will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
ultimately constitute a significant document in the
history of the evolution of pathological science.</i>

TO THE READER
</h2>

<p>
This book is not written to plead Marie Tarnowska's
cause. The strange Russian woman
whose hand slew no man, but whose beauty drove
those who loved her to commit murder for her
sake, will soon have ended her eight years' captivity
and will come forth into the world once more.
</p>

<p>
I have not sought in any way to minimize her
guilt, or attenuate her responsibility for the sin
and death that followed in her train. Though she
must be held blameless for the boy Peter Tarnowsky's
tragic fate and even for Dr. Stahl's suicide,
yet Bozevsky's death, Naumoff's downfall
and the murder of Count Kamarowsky will forever
be laid at her door.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to convey to the cool, sober mind
of the Anglo-Saxon reader—to whom much of this
amazing story of passion and crime may appear
almost incredible—that sequence of tragic events
which brought Marie Nicolaevna to her ruin.
</p>

<p>
Weighted by a heritage of disease (her mother
was a neurasthenic invalid and two of her aunts
are even now confined in an insane asylum in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
Russia), she was married when still on the threshold
of girlhood and swept into the maëlstrom of a
wild life—a frenzied, almost hallucinated, existence
such as is led by a certain section of the
Russian aristocracy, whom self-indulgence drives
to depths of degeneracy hardly to be realized by
the outside world.
</p>

<p>
With the birth of her child, Tania, Marie Tarnowska's
fragile health broke down completely,
and the few years preceding the tragedy which led
to her arrest were spent traveling through Europe
in a feverish quest of health or at least of oblivion
of her sufferings. According to such medical authorities
as Redlich, Fenomenof, Rhein, Bossi, and
many other eminent gynecologists and alienists,
she is, and has been for some years past, suffering
from a slow form of blood poisoning which affects
the nervous centers and the brain, and which—as
I myself had a painful opportunity of witnessing
when I saw her in prison—causes periodic cataleptic
seizures that imperil her life.
</p>

<p>
It was by one of her medical advisers, Professor
Luigi Bossi, of the University of Genoa, that the
idea of this book was first given to me.
</p>

<p>
“I was called as an expert for the defense at
the Venice trial,” said the Professor, “and I was
grieved and indignant at the heavy sentence inflicted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
upon this unhappy woman. Marie Tarnowska
is not delinquent, but diseased; not a
criminal, but an invalid; and her case, like that of
many other female transgressors, is one for the
surgeon's skill and the physician's compassionate
care, not for the ruthless hand of the law. Indeed,”
the illustrious Professor continued, “it is
becoming more and more a recognized fact that
many cases of criminality in woman have a physical,
not a moral origin. By her very mission—maternity—woman
is consecrated to pain; and
whereas by nature she is a creature of gentleness
and goodness, the effect of physical suffering, of
ailments often unconfessed—nay, often unrealized
by herself—is to transform her into a virago, a
hypochondriac, or a criminal. Then our duty is
to cure her, not to punish her.
</p>

<p>
“It may be merely a question,” he explained,
“of a slight surgical intervention; sometimes even
brief medical treatment is sufficient to save a
woman's life and reason. The wider knowledge
of this simple scientific fact in the social life of our
time would redeem and rehabilitate thousands of
unfortunate women who people the prisons and
the madhouses of the world.
</p>

<p>
“As for the unhappy Countess Tarnowska,”
added Professor Bossi, “the Venetian tribunal refused
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
to regard her as a suffering human being,
but flung her out of society like some venomous
reptile. Read these notes that she wrote in
prison,” he said, placing in my hand a book of
almost illegible memoranda. “If they touch your
heart, then do a deed of justice and generosity.
Go to the penitentiary of Trani, see the prisoner
yourself, and give her story to the world. So will
you perform an act of humanity and beneficence
by helping to diffuse a scientific truth in favor,
not of this one woman alone, but of all women.”
</p>

<p>
After glancing through the strange human document
he had given me I decided to do what he
asked; for, indeed, from those poor, incoherent
pages there seemed to rise the eternal cry of suffering
womanhood—the anguished cry of those
that perpetuate the gift of life—which no sister-soul
can hear unmoved.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that my mind was first directed to
the theme of this book and that I undertook the
task—fraught with almost insuperable difficulties—of
breaking down official prohibitions and reaching
the Russian captive in her distant Italian
prison.
</p>

<p>
And now that I have been brought face to face
with that strange and mournful figure, now that
I have heard her story from her own pale lips, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
am moved by the puissant impulse of art, which
takes no heed of learned theory or ethical code,
to narrate in these pages the profound impression
made upon me by that tragic personality, by the
story of that broken life.
</p>

<p>
I have endeavored to do so with faithfulness,
exaggerating nothing, coloring nothing, extenuating
nothing. It will be for the pontiffs of science
and morals to achieve the more complex task of
drawing conclusions and establishing theories that
may one day diminish injustice and suffering in
the world.

</div>

<p>
The verdant landscape of Tuscany swung past
the train that carried me southward. The looped
vineyards—like slim, green dancers holding hands—fled
backwards as we passed, and the rays of
the March sun pursued us, beating hotly through
the open windows on the dusty red velvet cushions
of the carriage.
</p>

<p>
Soon the train was throbbing and panting out
of Pisa, and the barefooted children of the Roman
Campagna stood to gaze after us, with eyes soft
and wild under their sullen hair.
</p>

<p>
Since leaving the station of Genoa I had seen
nothing of the fleeting springtide landscape; my
gaze and thoughts were riveted on the pages of
a copy-book which lay open on my knee—a
simple school copy-book with innocent blue-lined
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
sheets originally intended to contain the carefully
labored scrawls of some childish hand. A blue
ornamental flourish decked the front; and under
the printed title, “Program of Lessons,” the
words “History,” “Geography,” “Arithmetic,”
were followed by a series of blank spaces for the
hours to be filled in. Alas, for the tragic pupil to
whom this book belonged, in what school of horror
had she learned the lesson traced on these
pages by her slim, white hand—the fair patrician
hand which had known the weight of many jewels,
the thrill of many caresses, and was now held fast
in the merciless grip of captivity.
</p>

<p>
I turned the page: before me lay a flow of pale
penciled words in a sloping handwriting. At
every turn the flourish of some strange seignorial
name met my eye: long Russian names of prince,
of lover or of murderer. On every page was the
convulsion of death or the paroxysm of passion;
wine and morphia, chloral and cocaine surged
across the pallid sheets, like the wash of a nightmare
sea.
</p>

<p>
From the midst of those turbid billows—like
some ineffable modern Aphrodite—rose the pale
figure of Marie Nicolaevna Tarnowska.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The first words—traced by her trembling hand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
in the prison at Venice—are almost childish in
their simplicity.
</p>

<p>
“When I was eight years old, I fell ill with
measles and almost lost my eyesight. I wore blue
spectacles. I was very happy. My mother loved
me very much; so did my father. So did the servants.
Everybody loved me very much.”
</p>

<p>
I pause in my reading, loth to proceed. I wish
I could stop here with the little girl whom every
one loved and who gazed out through her blue
spectacles at a rose-colored world.
</p>

<p>
Ah! Marie Nicolaevna, had your luminous eyes
remained for all time hidden behind those dim
blue glasses, no one to-day would raise his voice
in execration of you, nor call anathema upon your
fair bowed head.
</p>

<p>
But when the little Russian countess was twelve
years old an oculist from Kieff ordered that her
eyes should be uncovered, and “Mura,” as her
parents fondly called her, looked out upon the
world with those clear light eyes that were one
day to penetrate the darkest depths of crime.
</p>

<p>
I continue to read without stopping. The serried
pages, scrawled feverishly and hurriedly in
the cells of La Giudecca in defiance of prison rules,
are in thin handwriting, with names and dates
harshly underlined; but here and there whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
sentences are struck out, as if the writer's memory
wavered, or her feelings altered as she
wrote.
</p>

<p>
Immediately, on the very first page, the bold
figure of young Vassili Tarnowsky confronts us:
the radiant, temerarious lover, who came to woo
her in her marveling adolescence.
</p>

<p>
“His voice thrilled the heart like the tones of
a violoncello; in his eyes were the lights of heaven,
in his smile all the promises of love. I was already
seventeen years old, and wise beyond my
years. But, sagacious as I thought myself, I could
never believe anything that was told me against
Vassili. My eyes saw nothing but his beauty. On
the twelfth day of April I ran away from home
with him; and we were married in a little church
far away on the desolate steppes. I never thought
that life could hold such joy.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f6"></a>
  <img src="images/6.jpg"
  alt="" />
<p class="caption">A PAGE FROM MARIE TARNOWSKA'S NOTE-BOOK</p>
</div>

<p>
But on the very next page we come face to face
with the astounding list of Vassili's perfidies: a
musical enumeration of feminine names which
rings the knell of his child-wife's happiness. “I
never thought,” writes Marie Tarnowska simply,
“that life could hold such sorrow.”
</p>

<p>
Further on there are gaps and incoherences;
here and there a passing efflorescence of literary
phrase, or a sudden lapse into curt narrative, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
if a wave of apathy had suddenly submerged the
tragic heroine and left in her place only a passive
narrator of fearful events. Now and then even
a note of strident humor is struck, more poignant,
more painful than pathos.
</p>

<p>
Ever and anon there appears throughout the
funereal story—as if smiling out through the window
of a charnel-house—the innocent face of a
child: Tioka. He is all bright curls and laughter.
Unaware of the carnage that surrounds him, he
runs with light, quick feet through pools of blood
to nestle in the gentle maternal breast which for
him is all purity and tenderness.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
As I read on and on the writing trembles and
wavers, as if the hand and the heart of the writer
wearied of their task. With a sudden break the
sad story closes, unfinished, incomplete.
</p>

<p>
“If I could tell of the tears I have shed, if I
could describe the anguish I have suffered, I am
sure that pity would be shown to me. Surely if
the world knew of my torment and my sufferings—”
</p>

<p>
Nothing more. Thus abruptly the tragic manuscript
ends.
</p>

<p>
The train slackens speed, falters, shivers—stops.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
I am at Trani; at the furthermost end of
Italy; almost beyond civilization; almost out of
the world.
</p>

<p>
Soon I shall see before me the woman I have
come so far to seek: the woman who never gave
the gift of love without the gift of death.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The high white walls of the penitentiary glared
down in the blazing southern sun. The languid
Adriatic trailed its blue silken waters past the
barred windows. I raised the heavy knocker; it
fell from my hand with a reverberating clang,
and the massive prison-door opened slowly before
me.
</p>

<p>
The Mother Superior and two gentle-looking
Sisters fluttered—black and white and timid as
swallows—across the sunlit courtyard. They
were expecting me.
</p>

<p>
“She whom you seek is in the chapel,” said the
Mother Superior, in a low voice. “I will call
her!” She left us. The two Sisters accompanied
me up a broad stone staircase to a small
waiting-room. Then they stood quietly beside
me; and when I looked at them, they smiled.
</p>

<p>
In the silence that followed I could hear
women's voices singing in the prison chapel, simple,
untutored voices, clear and shrill:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“Kyrie eleison</p>
<p>Christe eleison...”</p>
</div>

<p>
and the low notes of the organ rolled beneath the
treble voices, full and deep;
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“Mater purissima</p>
<p>Mater inviolata...”</p>
</div>

<p>
“Number 315—that is the Countess Marie,”
said one of the two Sisters, “plays the organ for
the other prisoners. She plays every day at noon
and evensong.”
</p>

<p>
“And at four o'clock in the morning,” added
the other Sister.
</p>

<p>
(How far, how far away, Marie Nicolaevna, are

nights of Venice!)

<p>
Suddenly the music ceased and we stood waiting
in the hot, white silence. Then the door opened,
and on the threshold stood Marie Tarnowska—the
murderess, the devastating spirit, the Erinnys.

<h2>
II
</h2>

<p>
Tall and motionless in her fearful striped dress
she stood, gazing at me with proud clear eyes;
her brow was calm and imperious under the humiliating
prisoner's coif, and her long hands—those
delicate hands whose caresses have driven
men to commit murder for her sake—hung loosely
at her side. Her mouth, curving and disdainful,
trembled slightly.
</p>

<p>
“Signora,” I began. Her lips wavered into a
faint smile as with a quick downward sweep of her
eyelashes she indicated her dress of shame.
</p>

<p>
“Signora,” I repeated, “I have come here
neither out of compassion nor curiosity.”
</p>

<p>
She was silent, waiting for me to proceed. The
three nuns had seated themselves quietly near the
wall, with eyes cast down and meek hands folded
in their laps.
</p>

<p>
“I have come,” I continued, “to vindicate my
sisters in your eyes. I know you think that all
women are ruthless and unkind.”
</p>

<p>
Another smile, fleeting, vivid and intelligent, lit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
up her eyes. Then the narrow face closed and
darkened again.
</p>

<p>
“For two years,” I proceeded, “I have been
haunted by the thought that you, shut in this
place, must be saying to yourself that all men are
base and all women pitiless. As to the men—I
cannot say. But I wish you to know that not all
women are without pity.”
</p>

<p>
She was silent a few moments. Then in a weak
voice she spoke:
</p>

<p>
“In the name of how many women do you bring
this message to me?”
</p>

<p>
I smiled in my turn. “There are four of us,”
I said, cheerfully. “Two Englishwomen, a Norwegian,
who is deaf and dumb—and myself. The
deaf and dumb one,” I added, “is really very intelligent.”
</p>

<p>
Marie Tarnowska laughed! It was a low, sudden
trill of laughter, and she herself seemed
startled at the unaccustomed sound. The Sisters
turned to look at her with an air of gentle amazement.
</p>

<p>
But in my eyes Marie Tarnowska had ceased to
be the murderess, the Erinnys. Through the
criminal in her dress of shame I had caught a
glimpse of the little girl in the blue spectacles, the
happy little girl who felt that every one loved her.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
That lonely, tremulous trill of laughter astray on
the tragic lips stirred me to the depths; and sudden
tears filled my eyes.
</p>

<p>
Marie Tarnowska saw this, and turned pale.
Then she sat down, unconsciously assuming the
same chastened attitude as the Sisters, her hands
submissively folded, her dark lashes cast down
over her long light eyes. For some time there
was silence.
</p>

<p>
“I have read your notes,” I said at last.
</p>

<p>
“My notes? I do not remember writing them.”
Suddenly her voice sounded harsh and her glance
flashed at me keen as a blade of steel.
</p>

<p>
“You wrote them in the prison at Venice, in
pencil, in a child's exercise book.”
</p>

<p>
“It may be so.” Marie Tarnowska breathed
a long sigh. “That was a time of dreams,” she
said, raising her stricken eyes to mine. “I sometimes
dream that this is all a dream. I think I
must have fallen asleep one day when I was a
little child, at home in Otrada—perhaps in our
garden on the swing. I used often to fall asleep
on that creaky old swing, reading a book, or looking
at the sky. Perhaps I shall wake up soon,
and find that none of all these dreadful things are
true.” She fingered the broad brown-and-white
stripes of her prison-garb and gazed round the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
dreary room. Then her eyes strayed from the
whitewashed walls, bare except for a large ebony
crucifix, to the narrow iron-barred window, and
back to the Sisters sitting along the wall like a
triptych of Renunciation, with folded hands and
lips moving silently in their habitual prayer.
“Yes, I shall wake up soon and find myself in our
old garden again. My mother will come down
the path and across the lawn, with her little white
shawl on her head; she will call me: 'Mura!
Mura! Where are you? Come, child, it is time
for tea; and Vassili is asking for you.' Then I
shall jump from the swing and run to her and
hide my face on her breast. 'Mother, if you knew
what a dream I have had—a terrible dream, all
about deaths and murders! I thought I had married
Vassili, and he was unkind to me—as if Vassili
could be unkind!—and I was locked in a prison
in Italy—imagine, mother, to be imprisoned in
Italy, where people only go for their honeymoon!'
And mother will kiss me and laugh at the crazy
dream as we go across the lawn together, happily,
arm in arm.”
</p>

<p>
I found no word to say, though her eyes seemed
to question me; and her fragile voice spoke again:
“Surely, this cannot all be true? It cannot be
true that they are all dead. My mother? And
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
little Peter? And Bozevsky? And Stahl? And
Kamarowsky? Why, it is like—like 'Hamlet.'”
She broke into strident laughter. “Do you remember
how they all die in 'Hamlet'? One here,
one there, one in the stream, one behind the curtain,
drowned, stabbed, strangled—” Suddenly
she was silent, looking straight before her with
startled eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Poor Mura!” I murmured, and lightly touched
her hand.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of the tender Russian appellative
she turned to me quickly. Then she began speaking
under her breath in hurried whispers.
</p>

<p>
“Who told you my name? Who are you? Are
you my sister Olga? Do you remember the
merry-go-round at the school-feast in Kieff? How
we cried when it swung us round and round and
round and would not stop? I seem to be still on
the merry-go-round, rushing along, hastening,
hurrying with the loud music pealing in my head.”
</p>

<p>
The Mother Superior rose and approached her.
“Hush,” she spoke in soothing tones. “You will
soon be quiet and at rest.”
</p>

<p>
But Marie Tarnowska paid no heed. Her eyes
were still fixed on mine with a despairing gaze.
“Wake me, wake me!” she cried. “And let me
tell you my dream.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
And during those long mild April days she told
it to me as follows.
</p>

<p>
Where shall I begin? Wait, let me think—ah,
yes! Where I fell asleep that day in the garden,
on the swing. I remember it was a hot day even
in Otrada; almost as hot as it is here. And it
was my birthday; I was sixteen years old. My
mother herself, with great solemnity, in the presence
of my father and sisters, had twisted up my
long curling hair and pinned it in great waves and
coils on the top of my head. There were to be no
more long plaits hanging down my back!
</p>

<p>
“Your childhood is over, Mura,” said my
mother. “At sixteen one has to look and behave
like a grown-up young lady.”
</p>

<p>
“That is exactly what I am, mother dear,” I replied
with great self-assurance.
</p>

<p>
My mother smiled and sighed and kissed me.
“You are such a child—such a child still, my little
snowdrop,” she said, and her eyes were tender
and anxious.
</p>

<p>
But I ran gaily out into the garden, feeling very
proud of my red-gold helmet of curls. I sprang
fearlessly on the swing, tossing my head from side
to side, delighted to feel the back of my neck cool
and uncovered to the breeze. What would Vassili
say to see me like this! But soon the hairpins
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
felt heavy; they pulled a hair or two here,
and a hair or two there, and hurt me. I stopped
the swing, and with my head bent forward I
quickly drew all the hairpins out and threw them
on the ground.
</p>

<p>
The heavy coils of hair loosened, untwisted like
a glittering snake, and fell all about me like a cloak
of gold. I leaped upon the swing again and,
standing, swung myself in wide flights through
the clear air. What joy it was! As I flew forward
my hair streamed out behind me like a flag,
and in the backward sweep it floated all about my
head in a whirling canopy of light.
</p>

<p>
I laughed and sang out loud to myself. How delightful
was the world! How blissful to be alive
and in the sunshine!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Vassili appeared at the end of the path
with my cousin, Prince Troubetzkoi. They were
coming towards me arm in arm, smoking cigarettes
and gazing at me. I felt shy of my loosened
hair; I should have liked to jump down and run
away, but the swing was flying too high and I could
not stop it.
</p>

<p>
The two men looked at me with strange intent
eyes, as no one had ever looked at me before. I
felt a hot blush rise to my cheeks like a flame.
Obeying a sudden, overmastering impulse I let go
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the ropes and covered my face with my hands.
I heard a cry—did it come from me?—then everything
whirled round me.... For an instant I saw
the gravel path rise straight in front of me as if
to strike me on the forehead. I threw myself
back, something seemed to crash into the nape of
my neck—and I remember no more.
</p>

<h2>
III
</h2>

<p>
I see the ensuing days as through a vague blue
mist. I see myself reclining in an armchair, and
my mother sitting beside me with her crochet-work.
She is crocheting something of yellow
wool. It is strange how the sight of that yellow
wool hurts and repels me, but I cannot find words
in which to express it, I seem unable to speak;
and mother crochets on calmly, with quick white
hands. I am conscious of a dull pain in the nape
of my neck. Then I see Vassili come in; he is
carrying an enormous cage in his hand; and Olga
follows him, laughing and radiant. “Here he is!
here he is!” cries Vassili triumphantly, putting
the cage down beside me; and in it, to my horror,
I see a parrot, a huge gray and scarlet creature,
twisting a hard black tongue round and round as
he clambers about the cage. I cry out in terror:
“Why—why do they bring me things that frighten
me?” And I burst into tears. Every one gazes
at me in amazement; my mother bends tenderly
over me: “But, my own darling, yesterday you
said you wanted to have a parrot. Vassili has
been all the way to Moscow to buy it for you.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
“No, no! it is not true! I never said I wanted
a parrot! Take it away! It frightens me. And
so does the yellow wool.” I hear myself weeping
loudly; then everything is blotted out and vanishes—parrot,
Vassili, yellow wool, Olga—nothing remains
but my mother's sad and anxious face bending
above me, dim and constant as the light of a
lamp in a shadowy chapel.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
When I was able to come down to breakfast for
the first time, my father stood waiting for me,
straight and solemn at the foot of the great staircase.
He gave me his arm with much ceremony
and led me to my place, where flowers lay in fragrant
heaps round my plate. Every one embraced
and complimented me and I was very happy.
</p>

<p>
“I feel as if I were a princess!” I cried, clapping
my hands; and they all laughed except my
father, who answered gravely:
</p>

<p>
“If it is your wish, you may become one. Prince
Ivan has asked for your hand.”
</p>

<p>
“Ivan? Ivan Troubetzkoi?” All the gladness
went out of my heart.
</p>

<p>
“Yes. And so has Katerinowitch,” exclaimed
Olga, with a bitter smile; and I noticed that she
looked pale and sad.
</p>

<p>
“Both Ivan and Katerinowitch? How extraordinary!”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Then glancing at my mother, whose
eyes were fixed upon her plate, I added jestingly,
“Is that all? No one else?”
</p>

<p>
My pleasantry fell flat, for no one answered, and
I saw my father knitting his brows. But my
mother lifted her eyes for an instant and looked
at me. In the blue light of that dear gaze I read
my happiness!
</p>

<p>
But Olga was speaking. “Yes,” she said,
“there is some one else. Vassili Tarnowsky has
asked to marry you.” And she added, with a
touch of bitterness: “I wonder what has possessed
all three of them!”
</p>

<p>
Vassili! Vassili! Vassili! The name rang
like a clarion in my ears. I should be Vassili's
wife! I should be the Countess Tarnowska—the
happiest woman in all this happy world. Every
other girl on earth—poor luckless girls who could
not marry Vassili—would envy me. On his arm
I should pass proudly and serenely through life,
rejoicing in his beauty, protected by his strength.
Sheltered on his breast the storms would pass over
my head, nor could sorrow ever touch me.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f20"></a>
  <img src="images/20.jpg"
  alt="" />
<p class="caption">COUNT O'ROURKE</p>
</div>

<p>
“I trust that your choice will fall on Troubetzkoi,”
said my father.
</p>

<p>
“Or on Vassili,” cried Olga quickly.
</p>

<p>
I jumped up and embraced her. “It shall not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
be Katerinowitch, that I promise,” I whispered,
kissing the little pink ear that nestled under her
fair curls. “He is to be for you!”
</p>

<p>
Time was to fulfil this prophecy.
</p>

<p>
As I went round the table, and passed my mother—poor
little nervous mother!—I laid my hand on
her arm. I noticed that she was trembling all
over. Then I summoned up courage and approached
my father.
</p>

<p>
“Father, dear, if you want your little Mura to
be happy, you must let her marry Vassili.”
</p>

<p>
“Never,” cried my father, striking the table
with his fist. The soul of the ancient O'Rourke—a
demoniacal Irish ancestor of ours whose memory
always struck terror to our souls—had awakened
in him. I saw Olga and my mother turn
pale. Nevertheless I laughed and kissed him
again. “If I do not marry Vassili, I shall die!
And please, father, do not be the Terrible
O'Rourke, for you are frightening mother!”
</p>

<p>
But papa, dominated by the atavistic influence
of the O'Rourke, grew even more terrible; and
mother was greatly frightened. She sat white and
rigid, with scarcely fluttering breath; suddenly in
her transparent eyes the pupils floated upward
like two misty pale-blue half-moons; she was in
the throes of one of her dreaded epileptic seizures.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Then they were all around her, helping her,
loosening her dress, fanning her; while I stood
aside trembling and woebegone, and the pains in
the nape of my neck racked me anew.
</p>

<p>
I said to myself that my father was hard and
wicked, that I should marry Vassili and carry
mother off with me, ever so far away!
</p>

<p>
As for papa, he should only be allowed to see us
once a year. At Christmas.
</p>

<p>
I have married Vassili.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
I pretended to be seized with such convulsions
that my poor dear mother, being at her wits' end,
at last allowed me to run away with him.
</p>

<p>
Do I say “I pretended”? I am not sure that
that is correct. At first the convulsions were certainly
a mere pretense. I would say to myself:
“Now I shall make myself have convulsions.” But
as soon as I had begun I could not stop. After I
had voluntarily gnashed my teeth they seemed to
become locked as in a vice; my fists that I had
purposely clenched would not reopen. My nails
dug into the palms of my hands, and I could see
the blood flowing down my wrists without being
able to unclasp or relax my fingers.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Orlof, summoned in haste from Kieff,
shook his head gravely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
“There are indications of epilepsy, due to the
fall from the swing.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, no!” I cried. “Not the swing! It is
because of Vassili!”
</p>

<p>
My mother trembled and wept.
</p>

<p>
How cruel we are in our childhood! How we
torture the mothers that adore us, even though
we love them with all our hearts. And oh! the
tragedy of not understanding this until it is too
late, when we can never, never ask for their forgiveness,
nor console them or atone to them
again.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
I married Vassili.
</p>

<p>
My father, more the Terrible O'Rourke than
ever, at once refused to have anything to do with
me. He denied me his kiss and his forgiveness.
I was very unhappy.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, don't bother your head about that tiresome
old man,” said Vassili, much annoyed by my
tears.
</p>

<p>
As for my mother, she could only entreat Vassili
to be kind and gentle with me.
</p>

<p>
“Take care of her, Vassili,” she implored. “I
have given her to you lest she should die of a
broken heart: but she is really too young to be
any one's wife—she is but a child! I do not know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
whether you understand me. Remember she is
not yet a woman. She is a child.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, yes,” said Vassili, without paying
much attention. “That's all right. I shall tweak
her nose if she is naughty.”
</p>

<p>
“And if I am good?” I asked, lifting ecstatic
eyes to his handsome nonchalant face.
</p>

<p>
“If you are good you shall have sweets and
kisses!” and he laughed, showing all his white
teeth.
</p>

<p>
“Promise me, Vassili, that you will always sing
my favorite song: 'Oh distant steppes, oh savage
plains,' to me, and to no one else.”
</p>

<p>
“To you and to no one else,” said Vassili with
mock solemnity. “Come then, Marie Tarnowska!”
and he drew my arm under his, patting my
hand on which the new nuptial ring shone in all
its brightness.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Marie Tarnowska!</i>” What a beautiful name!
I could have wished the whole world to know that
name; I could have wished that every one seeing
me should say: “Behold, behold Marie Tarnowska,
happiest and most blessed among women.”
</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
</p>

<h2>
IV
</h2>

<p>
On my wedding night, in the hotel at Kharkoff,
I summoned the chambermaid. She knocked and
entered. She was a pert, pretty creature, and
after surveying me from head to foot she threw
a rapid glance at Vassili. He was seated in an
armchair, lighting a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
“What is your name?” he asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
“Rosalia, at your service, sir,” she replied.
</p>

<p>
“Very good, Rosalia,” said my husband. “This
evening we shall do without you. Possibly in a
day or two I may wish to see you again.”
</p>

<p>
The girl laughed, made a slight curtsey, and
went out, closing the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
“But who is going to do my hair?” I asked,
feeling very much out of countenance and shy at
remaining alone with him.
</p>

<p>
“Never mind about your hair,” said Vassili.
“Don't be so tedious. You're a little bore.” And
he kissed me.
</p>

<p>
Then he sat down and smoked his cigarette,
watching me out of narrowed eyelids as I wandered
about the room in great trepidation and embarrassment.
I was about to kneel down by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
bedside to say my prayers, when he suddenly
grasped my wrist and held it tightly.
</p>

<p>
“What are you doing now?” he inquired.
</p>

<p>
“I am going to say my prayers,” I replied.
</p>

<p>
“Don't bother about your prayers,” he said.
“Try not to be such an awful little bore. Really
you are quite insufferable.”
</p>

<p>
But I would not have missed my prayers for
the world. At home prayers had always been a
matter of great importance. Olga and I used to
say them aloud in unison morning and evening.
And now that Olga was far away I must say them
alone. I buried my face in my hands and said
them devoutly, with all my heart.
</p>

<p>
They were, I admit, numerous and long; and
they were in many languages, for every nurse or
governess that came to us in Otrada had taught
us new ones; and Olga and I were afraid to leave
any out, lest God should be offended; we were also
rather doubtful as to which language He understood
the best.
</p>

<p>
I had just come to an English prayer—
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Now I lay me down to sleep</p>
<p>I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep.</p>
<p>If I should die before I wake...</p>
</div>

<p>
(Here Olga and I used always to interpolate a
short prayer of our own invention: “Please, dear
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
God, do not on any account let us die to-night.
Amen.”)—when Vassili interrupted me.
</p>

<p>
“Haven't you finished?” he cried, putting his
arm round my neck. “You are very tiresome.
You bore me to extinction.”
</p>

<p>
“You bore me!” That was the perpetual refrain
of all his days. I always bored him. Perhaps
it was not surprising. At seventeen one is
not always clever and entertaining, especially outside
the family circle. At home I had always been
considered rather witty and intelligent, but to
Vassili I was never anything but “a dreadful
bore.”
</p>

<p>
When I caught sight of him pinching Rosalia's
cheek and I burst into tears: “You are a fearful
bore,” he said crossly. If I noticed the scent of
musk or patchouli on his coat and ventured to
question him about it—“You are an insufferable
little bore,” would be all the answer I got. When
he went out (taking the music of “My Savage
Plains” with him) and stayed away all night, on
his return next morning I sobbed out my anguish
on his breast. “I must say you bore me to death,”
he yawned.
</p>

<p>
And one day I heard that he had had a child by
a German baroness.
</p>

<p>
At the sight of my paroxysm of despair he grew
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
angry. “What does it matter to you, silly
creature, since you have not got one yourself?”
he exclaimed. “Wearisome little bore that you
are; you can't even have a child.”
</p>

<p>
I was aghast. What—what did he mean?
Why could I not—?
</p>

<p>
“No! no!” he shouted, with his handsome mouth
rounded and open like those of the stone cherubs
on the walls of his castle, “you will never have
any children. You are not a woman. Your
mother herself said so.” And the look which he
flashed across my frail body cut me like a sword.
</p>

<p>
I fell fainting to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Then he became alarmed. He called everybody.
He summoned the whole staff of the hotel. He
sent for all the ladies he knew in Kharkoff (and
they were many) imploring them all to save me,
to recall me to life. When I came to myself the
room was filled with women: there was Rosalia,
and two Hungarian girls from the adjoining
apartment, and there was also the German
baroness, and little Julia Terlezkaja, the latest and
fairest of my husband's conquests. All these
graceful creatures were bending over my couch,
while Vassili on his knees with his head buried
in the coverlet was sobbing: “Save her! She is
dead! I have killed her!”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
I put out my hand and touched his hair.
</p>

<p>
“I am alive,” I said softly; and he threw himself
upon me and kissed me. The women stood
round us in a semi-circle, gay and graceful as the
figures on a Gobelin tapestry.
</p>

<p>
“I love you,” Vassili was exclaiming; “I love
you just as you are. I should hate you to be like
everybody else.” And in French he added, looking
at Madame Terlezkaja: “C'est très rigolo
d'avoir une femme qui n'est pas une femme.”
</p>

<p>
I hid my face in the pillow, and wept; while
the fair Terlezkaja, who seemed to be the kindest
of them all, bent over and consoled me.
</p>

<p>
“Pay no heed to him,” she whispered. “I
think he has been drinking a little.”
</p>

<p>
The door opened. A doctor, who had been sent
for by the manager of the hotel, entered with a
resolute authoritative air. At the sight of him the
women disappeared like a flight of startled sparrows.
Of course they took Vassili with them.
</p>

<p>
To the good old doctor I confided the secret
which Vassili had disclosed to me and which was
burning my heart.
</p>

<p>
“I want to have a child, a little child of my
own!” I cried.
</p>

<p>
“Of course. Of course. So you shall,” said
the old doctor, with a soothing smile. “There is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
no reason why you should not. You are a little
anemic, that is all.”
</p>

<p>
He scribbled some prescriptions on his tablets.
</p>

<p>
“There. You will take all that. And you will
go to Franzensbad. Within a year you will be
asking me to act as godpapa.”
</p>

<p>
I took all he prescribed. But I did not go to
Franzensbad. Vassili wanted to go to Petersburg,
so, of course, it was to Petersburg we went.
</p>

<p>
The very first evening we were there a number
of his friends came to call on him.
</p>

<p>
I remember, among the rest, a certain German
Grand Duke, who, after showing me an infinite
amount of attention, drew Vassili aside and spoke
to him in undertones. I heard him mention the
name of a famous restaurant and the words: “A
jolly supper-party to-night—some ravishingly
pretty tziganes....” There followed names of
men and women whom I did not know, and my
husband laughed loudly.
</p>

<p>
Then the Grand Duke turned to me, and bowing
deeply and ceremoniously kissed my hand.
</p>

<p>
For an instant a frenzied impulse came over
me to clutch that well-groomed head and cry:
“Wicked man! Why are you trying to lure my
husband from me?” But social conventions prevailed
over this elementary instinct, and when the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Grand Duke raised his patrician head he found
me all amiability and smiles.
</p>

<p>
“She is indeed a bewitching creature!” I
heard him mutter to Vassili. “Looks just like
one of Botticelli's diaphanous angels. Well then,
at eleven o'clock to-night, at the 'Hermitage.'”
</p>

<p>
Promptly at a quarter to eleven Vassili, sleek,
trim and immaculate, kissed my cheek gaily and
went out.
</p>

<p>
I was alone. Alone in the great drawing-room,
gorgeous with lights and mirrors and gilded
decorations. What was the good of being a bewitching
creature? What was the good of looking
like one of Botticelli's diaphanous angels?...
</p>

</h2>

<p>
I rang for my maid, Katja, a good creature, ugly
beyond words—and gladly chosen by me on that
account—and I told her that she was to undress
me for I was going to bed. While she was unfastening
my dress I could hear her muttering: “If
it were me, I should not go to bed. If it were me,
I should put on my diamonds and my scarlet chiffon
gown; I should take a good bottle of vitriol in
my pocket, and go and see what they were up to.”
</p>

<p>
“Katja, what are you mumbling? Do you mean
to say that you—that you think I ought to go—?”
</p>

<p>
“Of course,” she cried, and her small squinting
eyes shot forth, to the right and left, fierce, divergent
flashes of indignation. “Why should my
lady not go?”
</p>

<p>
Why should I not, indeed? Had I not the right—nay,
the duty—to follow Vassili? Had I not
most solemnly promised so to do, in the little
church on the steppes a year ago? “<i>Follow
him!</i>” With what tremulous joy had I repeated
after the priest those two words of tenacity and
submission. Had they no application to the
Hermitage restaurant?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
“Perhaps I might venture to go,” I murmured,
“but, Katja, do not other women always have
rouge and powder to put on when they go out? I
have nothing.”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing but your eighteen years, madame,” replied
Katja.
</p>

<p>
She dressed me in the low-necked scarlet chiffon
gown. She drew on my flame-colored stockings,
and my crimson shoes. On my head she placed the
diamond and ruby tiara, and about my shoulders
she wound a red and gold scarf which looked like
a snake of fire.
</p>

<p>
“Alas, Katja!” I sighed as I looked at myself
in the mirror; “what would my mother say if she
were to see me like this? What do I look like?”
</p>

<p>
“You look like a lighted torch,” said Katja.
</p>

<p>
I made her come with me in the troika, which
sped swiftly and silently through the dim snow-covered
streets. I was shaking with fear at the
thought of Vassili. Katja was mumbling some
prayers.
</p>

<p>
We drew up at the brilliant entrance of the restaurant.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, heavens, Katja! What will my husband
say?”
</p>

<p>
“He will say that you are beautiful.”
</p>

<p>
How did I ever venture across that threshold of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
dazzling light? How was I able to ascend the red-carpeted
stairs, preceded and followed by bows
and smiles and whispers? At the head of the wide
staircase, in front of a double-paneled door of
white and gold, I paused with beating heart, almost
unable to breathe. I could hear the gipsy-music
inside, and women's voices and men's laughter
and the tinkling of glasses.
</p>

<p>
An impassive head-waiter stood before me,
calmly awaiting my orders.
</p>

<p>
“Tell”—I stammered—“tell—” as I thought of
Vassili my courage failed me—“tell his Highness
the Grand Duke that I wish to see him.”
</p>

<p>
Then I clung to the balustrade and waited. As
the door opened and was quickly closed again,
there came forth a puff of heat and sound which
enwrapped me like a flame.
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately the door opened again and
the Grand Duke appeared upon the threshold, his
countenance still elated by recent laughter. He
stared at me in astonishment, without recognition.
“What—what can I do for you?” he asked. Then
his eyes widened in limitless astonishment.
“Upon my word! It is the Botticelli angel!”
</p>

<p>
I said “Yes,” and felt inclined to weep.
</p>

<p>
“Come in, come in!” he cried eagerly, taking me
by the arm and leading me to the door.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
A waiter threw it wide open. I had a dazzling
vision of a table resplendent with crystal, silver,
and flowers, and the bare jeweled shoulders of
women.
</p>

<p>
“Tarnowsky!” called the Grand Duke from the
threshold. “Fortunate among men! Behold—the
most glorious of your conquests!”
</p>

<p>
Vassili had started to his feet and was looking
at me with amazed and incredulous eyes. There
was a deep silence. I felt as if I should die. Vassili
came up to me. He took me brusquely by the
hand, crushing my fingers in his iron clasp. “You
are mad!” he said. Then he looked at me from
head to foot—not with the gaze of a husband, nor
yet with that of a lover, but with the cold curious
scrutiny of the perfect connoisseur.
</p>

<p>
“Come,” he said at last, drawing me towards
the others who were in a riot of laughter. “I
have always told my friends that you were a chilling,
lily-white flake of snow. You are not!” And
he laughed. “You are a blazing little firebrand!
Come in!”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Thenceforward my husband would always have
me with him. My untutored adolescence was
trailed from revelry to revelry, from banquet to
orgy; my innocence swept into the maelstrom of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
licentious life. I was forced to look into the
depths of every depravity; to my lips was proffered
every chalice of shame.
</p>

<p>
Oh, if as I stood trembling on the confines of
maidenhood, some strong and tender hand had
drawn me into safety, should not I have been like
other women, those happy women who walk with
lofty brows in the sunshine, august and ruthless in
their purity?
</p>

<p>
But, alas! when with tardy and reluctant step I
issued forth from my long childhood, a thousand
cruel hands were thrust out to push me towards
the abyss.
</p>

<p>
Oh, white pathway of innocence which knows no
return! Oh, tenuous light of purity which, once
quenched, kindles no more! Did I not grieve and
mourn for you when I lost you before my twentieth
year? Sadly, enviously, like some poor exile, I
saw other girls of my age passing in blithe security
by the side of their mothers, blushing at an eager
word or at a daring glance. Alas! I felt that I
was unworthy to kiss the hem of their skirts.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
But bliss was to be vouchsafed to me. Redeeming
and triumphant there came to me at last the
Angel of Maternity. With proud humility I bore
the little human flower fluttering in my breast.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
At every throb of life I felt myself swooning with
joy—with the ineffable joy of my reconquered
purity.
</p>

<p>
My mother was with me, and in the tender haven
of her arms I found shelter for my meek and
boundless ecstasy.
</p>

<p>
How is it possible, I asked myself, that there
are women who dread this perfect happiness, who
weep and suffer through these months fraught
with rapturous two-fold life?
</p>

<p>
For me, I felt like a flowering plant in springtime,
impelled by some potent influence towards
its perfect blossoming. The whole of that blissful
period seemed a sublime ascent to unalloyed felicity;
everything enchanted me, from the awed and
tremulous waiting to the final crowning consummation.
</p>

<p>
When at last the fragile infant—my son!—lay
in my arms, he seemed to me sufficient to fill my
entire life. I nursed him into ever-growing wonder
and beauty. Day by day he seemed fairer,
more entrancing, like a delicate flower in some
fantastic lunar legend.
</p>

<p>
Oh, the wee groping hands against my face!
The wilful little caprices, the cries like those of
an angry dove! And the dimples on the elbows;
the droll battle with the little cap always awry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and the joyous impatience of the tiny kicking feet!
</p>

<p>
Each day my mother and I invented new names
for him—names of little flowers, names of little
animals, nonsense-names made up of sweet senseless
sounds.
</p>

<p>
I had no thought, I had no desire. Pale and
pure I sat enthroned in the milk-white paradise
of maternity.
</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
</p>

<h2>
VI
</h2>

<p>
Soon after that my thoughts are adrift, my recollections
grow confused. I see my mother with
my baby in her arms, and myself in traveling attire,
with my arms twined about them, weeping,
despairing, refusing to leave them and set out on
a journey of Vassili's planning. But Vassili
grows impatient. Vassili grows angry. He is
tired of playing the papa, tired of seeing me no
longer a little “firebrand,” but calm as a young
Madonna in the beatific purity of motherhood.
</p>

<p>
Vassili has taken it into his head that he wants
to study singing. He has made up his mind to
go to Italy, to Milan, to study scales and exercises;
and I must go with him.
</p>

<p>
“But our baby, Vassili, our little Tioka! We
must take our baby with us!”
</p>

<p>
No. Vassili does not want babies. He does
not want to be bothered or hindered. “We are
carting about eight trunks as it is!” he says,
cynically.
</p>

<p>
And so we start for Italy—Italy, the yearned-for
goal of all my girlish dreams.
</p>

<p>
At Milan Vassili sings. I seem always to see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
him with his handsome mouth open, singing scales
and arpeggios. But a slow poison is creeping
through my blood and I fall ill, ill with typhoid
fever.
</p>

<p>
Again my thoughts go adrift and my recollections
are confused. They dance in grotesque and
hideous visions through my brain. I see livid
hallucinated faces peering at me, towers and
mountains tottering above me, undefined horrors
all about me, and in the midst of them all I see
Vassili—singing! He sings scales and arpeggios
with his rounded open mouth. Now I can see a
white spider—no, two white spiders—running
about on a scarlet coverlet.... They are my
hands. They frighten me. And Vassili is singing.
</p>

<p>
“Vassili, why are you singing? Don't sing!
Don't sing!”
</p>

<p>
“No, darling, I am not singing. You only
imagine it. You are ill; you are feverish. Calm
yourself.”
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
“Vassili, where is my baby?”
</p>

<p>
“At home in Kieff, with grandmama. Dear
grandmama is taking such good care of him!”
</p>

<p>
“And why are we not with him? Where are
we?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
“We are at Pegli, darling.”
</p>

<p>
“Why? Why? Where is Pegli? What are
we doing at Pegli?”
</p>

<p>
“Come now, dearest; you know—we came to
Italy because I wanted to sing—”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you see! You wanted to sing! Why do
you want to sing when the baby is crying? The
baby is so helpless. Why did you take me away
from him? You sing, you sing so loud that I cannot
hear my baby crying. Don't sing!”
</p>

<p>
But even as I speak I see that Vassili has his
round mouth open again and he sings and sings,
and the white spiders run over the scarlet counterpane
and come close to my face—and the white
spiders are my hands. I shriek and shriek to
have them taken away. But the baby is crying
and Vassili is singing and no one hears me.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
Then I drop down to the bottom of a deep well.
I feel myself falling, falling, until with a great
shock I touch the bottom. And there I lie motionless
in the dark.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
When I open my eyes there is a great deal of
light; the windows are open, the sun is pouring
in; I know that outside there is the sea. Beside
my bed sits a doctor with a gray beard, feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
my pulse. Under the light intermittent pressure
of his fingers my pulse seems to grow quieter; I
can see the doctor's head giving little nods as he
counts the beats.
</p>

<p>
“Sixty-five. Excellent, excellent!” The doctor
pats my hand gently and encouragingly.
“That is first-rate. We are quite well again.”
</p>

<p>
Then I hear some one weeping softly, and I
know it is my mother. I try to turn and smile
at her, but my head will not move. It is like a
ball of lead sunk in the pillow. Immediately
afterwards—or have years passed?—I hear some
one say: “Here is the Professor!” And again
the same doctor with the gray beard comes in and
smiles at me.
</p>

<p>
Before sitting down beside the bed he turns to
my mother: “Has she not yet asked about her
child?” My mother shakes her head and presses
her handkerchief to her eyes. Then the doctor
sits down beside my bed and strokes my forehead
and speaks to me.
</p>

<p>
He speaks about a baby. He repeats a name
over and over again—perhaps it is Tioka. Tioka?
Who is Tioka? I watch his beard moving up and
down, and do not know what he is saying. The
ball of lead on my pillow rolls from side to side
with a dull and heavy ache.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
My mother weeps bitterly: “Oh, doctor, do not
let her die!”
</p>

<p>
The white spiders are there again, running over
the coverlet. And I fall once more, down, down,
down, to the bottom of the well.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
</p>

<h2>
VII
</h2>

<p>
For how many months was I ill? I do not
know. Vassili, restless and idle, “carted” me
and my medicines and my sufferings from Pegli
to Genoa, from Genoa to Florence. He seemed
to have forgotten that we had a home; he seemed
to have forgotten that we had a child.
</p>

<p>
Our rooms at the hotel in Florence were bright
with sunshine and with the frivolous gaiety of
a graceful trio of Russian ladies—the Princess
Dubinskaja, her sister Vera Vojatschek, and the
fair-haired Olga Kralberg, who came to see us
every day. But I felt lost and lonely, as if astray
in the world. My mother had returned to Russia,
and my vacant and aching heart invoked Vassili,
who, alas! was never by my side.
</p>

<p>
“You must win him back,” said Olga Kralberg
to me one day—she, whose fate it was on a not
distant day to commit suicide for his sake.
“Every man, especially if he is a husband, has—after
some time—to be won back again.”
</p>

<p>
“That is sooner said than done,” I replied
despondently. “To win a man is easy enough.
But to win him back—”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
“There are various ways of doing it,” she said.
“Have you tried being very affectionate?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, indeed,” said I.
</p>

<p>
“How did it answer?”
</p>

<p>
“He was bored to death.”
</p>

<p>
“Have you tried being cool and distant? Being,
so to speak, a stranger to him?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I have.”
</p>

<p>
“And he?”
</p>

<p>
“He never even noticed that I was being a
stranger to him. He was as happy and good-tempered
as ever.”
</p>

<p>
Olga shook her head dejectedly. “Have you
tried being hysterical?” she asked after a while.
</p>

<p>
I hesitated. “I think so,” I said at last. “But
I do not quite know what you mean.”
</p>

<p>
“Well,” explained Olga sententiously, “with
some men, who cannot bear healthy normal
women, hysteria is a great success. Of course, it
must be esthetic hysteria—you must try to preserve
the plastic line through it all,” and Olga
sketched with her thumb a vague painter's gesture
in the air. “For example, you deluge yourself
in strange perfumes. You trail about the house
in weird clinging gowns. You faint away at the
sight of certain shades of color—”
</p>

<p>
“What an absurd idea!” I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
“Not at all. Not in the least,” said Olga.
“On the contrary, it is very modern, very piquant
to swoon away every time you see a certain shade
of—of mauve, for instance.”
</p>

<p>
“But what if I don't see it?”
</p>

<p>
“Silly! You <i>must</i> see it. Give orders to a
shop to send you ten yards of mauve silk. Open
the parcel in your husband's presence. Then—then
you totter; you fall down—but mind,” added
Olga, “that you fall in a graceful, impressionist
attitude. Like this.” And Olga illustrated her
meaning in what appeared to me a very foolish
posture.
</p>

<p>
“I think it ridiculous,” I said to her. And she
was deeply offended.
</p>

<p>
“Good-by,” she said, pinning her hat on briskly
and spitefully.
</p>

<p>
“No, no! Don't go away. Do not desert me,”
I implored. “Try to suggest something else.”
</p>

<p>
Olga was mollified. After reflecting a few moments
she remarked.
</p>

<p>
“Have you tried being a ray of sunshine to
him?”
</p>

<p>
I lost patience with her. “What do you mean
by a 'ray of sunshine'? You seem to be swayed
by stock phrases, such as one reads in novels.”
</p>

<p>
This time Olga was not offended. She explained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
that in order to be a ray of sunshine in a
man's life, one must appear before him gay,
sparkling and radiant at all hours of the day.
</p>

<p>
“Always dress in the lightest of colors. Put
a ribbon in your hair. When you hear his footsteps,
run to meet him and throw your arms round
his neck. When he goes out, toss a flower to him
from the window. When he seems dull or silent,
take your guitar and sing to him.”
</p>

<p>
“You know I don't play the guitar,” I said
pettishly.
</p>

<p>
“That does not matter. What really counts is
the singing. The atmosphere that surrounds him
should be bright with unstudied gaiety. He ought
to live, so to speak, in a whirlwind of sunshine!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, I will try,” I sighed, without much conviction.
</p>

<p>
I did try.
</p>

<p>
I dressed in the lightest of colors and I pinned
a ribbon in my hair. When I heard his footstep,
I ran to meet him and threw my arms round his
neck.
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter?” he asked. “And what
on earth have you got on your head? You look
like a barmaid.”
</p>

<p>
To the best of my powers I was a whirlwind of
sunshine; and as soon as I saw that he was dull
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and silent (and this occurred almost immediately)
I said to myself that the moment was come for me
to sing to him.
</p>

<p>
I sat down at the piano. I have not much ear,
but a fine strong voice, even if not always quite
in tune.
</p>

<p>
At the second bar Vassili got up, took his hat
and left the house. I threw a flower to him from
the window.
</p>

<p>
He did not come back for three days.
</p>

<h2>
VIII
</h2>

<p>
When I talked it over with Olga, she was very
sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
“I know,” she mused, “that these things sometimes
succeed and sometimes do not. Men are not
all alike.” Then she added: “But there is one
sure way of winning them back. It is an old
method, but infallible.”
</p>

<p>
“What is it?” I asked skeptically.
</p>

<p>
“By making them jealous. It is vulgar, it is
<i>rococo</i>, it causes no end of trouble. But it is infallible.”
</p>

<p>
We reviewed the names of all the men who could
possibly be employed to arouse Vassili's jealousy.
We could think of no one. I was surrounded by
nothing but women.
</p>

<p>
“It is past belief,” said Olga, surveying me
from head to foot, “that there should be no one
willing to—”
</p>

<p>
I shook my head moodily. “No one on earth.”
</p>

<p>
Olga grasped my wrist. “Stay! I have an
idea. We will get some one who is not on earth.
Some one who is dead. It will be much simpler.
I remember there was an idea of that kind in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
an unsuccessful play I saw a year or two ago.
What we need is a dead man—recently dead, if
possible, and, if possible, young. If he has committed
suicide, so much the better.”
</p>

<p>
“What on earth do you want with a dead man?”
I asked, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
“Why! can't you see? We will say that he died
for your sake!” cried Olga, “that he killed himself
on your account. We will have a telegram
sent to us by some one in Russia. We will get
them to telegraph to you: 'I die for your sake.
Am killing myself. Farewell!'”
</p>

<p>
“But who is to sign it?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, somebody or other,” said Olga vaguely.
“Or we could have it signed with an imaginary
name, if you prefer it. That would enable us to
dispense with the corpse.”
</p>

<p>
“I most certainly prefer that,” I remarked.
“But, frankly, I can't see—”
</p>

<p>
“What can't you see? Don't you see the effect
upon Vassili of the news that a man has killed
himself for your sake? Don't you see the new
irresistible attraction which you will then exercise
over him? Surely you know what strange subtle
charm emanates from the 'fatal woman'—the
woman whose lethal beauty—”
</p>

<p>
“Very well, very well,” I said, slightly encouraged.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
“Let us have the telegram written and sent
to me.”
</p>

<p>
We spent the rest of the afternoon composing it.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Three days later Vassili entered the drawing-room
where Olga and I were having tea; he held
a telegram in his hand; his face was of a ghastly
pallor.
</p>

<p>
“He's got it,” whispered Olga hysterically,
pinching my arm.
</p>

<p>
“Mura,” said Vassili; “a horrible thing has
happened. Horrible!” His white lips trembled
as he uttered the incoherent words:
</p>

<p>
“Dead—he is dead—he has killed himself—”
</p>

<p>
He was unable to go on. His voice broke in
a sob.
</p>

<p>
I sprang to my feet. “Who, Vassili? Who?”
</p>

<p>
Olga thought the moment had arrived for putting
things in the proper light. She turned to me
with a significant glance, and grasped my hand.
</p>

<p>
“Ah! It is the man who loved you!” she exclaimed.
“And this—this is what you dreaded!”
</p>

<p>
“What! What!” shouted Vassili, clutching
her arm and pushing her roughly aside. Then
he turned upon me and seized me by the shoulder.
“You—you knew of this? You dreaded this?”
</p>

<p>
I stood trembling, struck dumb with terror. I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
could hear the futile and bewildered explanations
of Olga:
</p>

<p>
“Why, surely,” she was saying with an insensate
smile, “it is a thing that might happen to
anybody. It is not her fault if people love her
to distraction.”
</p>

<p>
But Vassili was crushing my wrist. “My
brother—he loved you?” he gasped.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Your brother?</i> Your brother—little Peter?”
I stammered.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes! Peter,” shouted Vassili. “My
brother! What have you to do with his death?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing, nothing.” I groaned. “I swear it—nothing!”
</p>

<p>
And Olga, realizing at last that she stood in the
presence of a genuine tragedy and not of the jest
we had plotted, darted forward and caught his
arm.
</p>

<p>
“Vassili, you are mistaken. She knows nothing
about it; nothing whatever. We had planned a
joke to play on you, and we thought—” She
pursued her agitated and incoherent explanations.
</p>

<p>
Vassili looked from one to the other of us, scanning
our faces, hardly hearing what Olga was saying.
Suddenly he seemed to understand, and
loosening his hold on my arm he fell upon the
couch and buried his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
The telegram had dropped on the carpet. Olga
picked it up and read it; then she handed it to me:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
<i>Peter hanged himself last night. Come at once.</i>
</p>

<p class="indr">
<span class="smcap">Tarnowsky.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We left for Kieff the same evening. Throughout
the entire journey Vassili never spoke. I sat
mournful and silent opposite him and thought of
my brother-in-law, Peter. Not of the pale youth,
already corrupted by absinthe and women, whom
we had left at Kieff a few months before, but of
the child Peter, in his short velvet suit and lace
collar, whom I had loved so dearly in the days of
my girlhood—little Peter who used to run to meet
me in the sun-splashed avenues of the Villa Tarnowsky,
trotting up with his little bare legs and
serious face, stopping to be kissed and then trotting
hurriedly off again, the nape of his neck showing
fair and plump beneath the upturned brim of
his sailor-hat.
</p>

<p>
How well I remember that sailor-hat! The
black ribbon round the crown bore, between two
anchors, the word, “<i>Implacable</i>”; and from under
that fierce device the round and gentle countenance
of little Peter gazed mildly out into the
world.
</p>

<p>
Little Peter's legs were always cold. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
brought up in English fashion, with short socks
even in the depths of winter. From afar you
could see little Peter's chilly bare legs, crimson
against a background of snow. Sometimes, rubbing
his knees, he would say to me: “I wish God
had made me of fur, instead of—of leather, like
this.” And again he would remark: “I don't
like being alive. Not that I want to die; but I
wish I had never begun.”
</p>

<p>
And now little Peter had finished. Little Peter
lay solemn and magnificent in the <i>chambre ardente</i>
where his dead ancestors had lain solemn and
magnificent before him. “Implacable” indeed
he lay, unmoved by the tears of his mother and
father; his lofty brow was marble; his fair eyelashes
lowered over his quenched and upturned
eyes.
</p>

<p>
When I thought of him thus I felt afraid.
</p>

<p>
And it seemed strange to be afraid of little
Peter.
</p>

</p>

<h2>
IX
</h2>

<p>
After we had crossed the Russian frontier
another thought—a thought that filled me with
unspeakable happiness—put all others to flight:
my child! I should see my child again! All our
relations would certainly be assembled at the
Tarnowskys' house, so I should find my parents
and my little Tioka there too. The image of the
living child soon displaced the tragic memory of
the dead youth. As the train sped towards Kieff
my fever of gladness and impatience increased.
Yes, to-morrow would be poor Peter's funeral, but
this very evening I should clasp little Tioka in
my arms!
</p>

<p>
Raising my eyes, I saw that Vassili was looking
at me with a scowl. “I have been watching you
for some time,” he said. “Heartless creature
that you are, to laugh—to laugh in the face of
death.”
</p>

<p>
“I was thinking of Tioka,” I stammered.
Vassili did not reply. But in the depths of my
heart joy sang and whispered like a hidden
fountain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Thus, inwardly rejoicing, did I enter the house
of death and hasten to the dark-red room—the
very scene of Peter's suicide—in which they had
placed my baby's cradle; thus, while others
mourned with prayers and tears in the gloomy
death-chamber, I ran across the sun-filled garden
holding my infant to my breast. I hid myself
with him in the orchard and laughed and laughed
aloud, as I kissed his starry eyes and his tiny,
flower-like mouth.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
But Death, the Black Visitor, had entered my
life. Little Peter had shown him the way, had
opened the door to him.
</p>

<p>
From that day forward the dread Intruder
never forsook my threshold.
</p>

<p>
Death, lurking at my door in terrifying silence,
stretched out his hand at intervals and clutched
some one belonging to me. Generally it was with
a swift gesture—a fell disease or a pistol-shot—that
he struck down and flung into the darkness
those I loved.
</p>

<p>
But towards me Death comes with a slower,
more deliberate tread. For years, ever since the
birth of my little daughter Tania,—my white rosebud
born midst the snows of a dreary winter in
Kieff—I have felt Death creeping towards me,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
slow, insidious, inexorable, holding in his hand a
knot of serpents, each of which will fasten its
poisoned fangs upon me. Disease, the venomous
snake, will hide in my bosom and thrust its way
through my veins. The heavy snake of Grief will
coil round my heart and crush me in its spirals.
Insanity will glide into my brain and nest there.
Then—last but not least horrible—the little glass
viper, the syringe of Pravaz, whose fang is a hollow
needle, will draw me into the thraldom of its
virulent grip. It will spurt its venom into my
blood. The bland balm of coca, the milky juice of
the poppy, will flow into my veins, soothing,
assuaging, lulling me into sleep and forgetfulness—only
to waken me in renewed agony of suffering
to a renewed bite of the envenomed fang. For the
only antidote to the poison of narcotics is the
narcotic itself, the only alleviation to the tearing
agony of the poison generated by morphia is morphia
again. And so the fatal sequence swings on
forever, in ever-widening circles of torment....

<i>From Alexis Bozevsky to Stepan Nebrasoff.</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="indr">
<span class="smcap">Kieff</span>, <i>Thursday</i>.
</p>

<p class="indl">
<span class="smcap">Dear Stepan, my good Friend,</span>—
</p>

<p>
I am here in the house of your cousin, Dr. Stahl, who
seems to have grown longer and leaner than ever. He is a
mere shadow. It is here that your letter reaches me. You tell
me to write to you about myself. To-day, the 15th of October,
1903, I am twenty-four years old. What gift will Destiny
give me for my birthday? Love? Wealth? A hero's death?
</p>

<p>
Your cousin Stahl, in his cavernous voice that seems to come
echoing up from underground, says that the gift of Destiny
is precisely these four-and-twenty years of mine! Perhaps he
is right. I feel them eddying in my blood like four-and-twenty
cyclones.
</p>

<p>
The world is a whirlwind of youth.
</p>

<p>
Kaufmann this morning lent me his sorrel stallion—the
finest horse in the Empire—and I had a gallop along the
bastions. All the women looked at me. In a phaeton I saw
the brazen and beautiful Princess Theodora, blonde and torrid
as a Mexican landscape. She was resplendent in amethyst
and heliotrope, her red locks flaming to the sun; no one but a
princess would permit herself to display such a riot of violent
colors.
</p>

<p>
Soon afterwards I saw Vera Voroklizkaja, reclining in her
carriage, aloof and severe as a vestal virgin; her glossy black
tresses parted over her brow enclosed the narrow oval of her
face like soft black wings. Beside her sat little Miriam Grey,
clothed in her youthfulness as in an armor of roses. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
beauty of all these women courses through my blood like sun
and wine.
</p>

<p>
Upon my word life is an excellent institution.
</p>

<p>
And you—what are you doing?
</p>

<p class="indr">
<span class="spacer6">Ever yours,</span>
<br />
<span class="smcap">Bozevsky.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="center">
<i>The next day.</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="indl">
<span class="smcap">Stepan, Stepan, Stepan!</span>—
</p>

<p>
I am in love! Madly, sublimely, tragically in love! This
morning I went to the parade-ground as in a dream; I found
myself speaking to the colonel in a gentle winning voice that
was perfectly ludicrous. When I drilled my company I could
hear myself giving the words of command in an imploring
tone which I still blush to remember. I am obsessed, hallucinated;
there floats before my eyes a slender, ethereal creature,
with red lips that never smile, and hair that looks like a cataract
of champagne.
</p>

<p>
Stahl introduced me to her yesterday, here at his house.
“Come,” he said, taking me by the arm. “You are going to
make the acquaintance of a superior being, soft of voice and
sad of countenance, who bears the gentle name of Marie.”
</p>

<p>
“Let me off,” I replied skeptically. “Sad and superior beings
are not to my liking.”
</p>

<p>
“You will like this one,” said Stahl.
</p>

<p>
“I know I shan't,” I replied curtly. I saw Stahl's eye warn
me, and, turning, found myself face to face with the subject of
our conversation, a tall, flower-like vision, with translucent
eyes and a mystic inscrutable face.
</p>

<p>
I knew she had overheard me, and as I bowed low before her,
she said: “That you should like me is of no importance.
What really matters is that I should be pleased with you.”
</p>

<p>
Her beauty and the scornful levity of her words struck me
strangely. “Madame,” and I was surprised to feel that I spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
with sincerity, “to please you will be henceforward the highest
aim of my desire.”
</p>

<p>
She looked at me a moment; then she spoke quietly: “You
have attained your aim.”
</p>

<p>
She turned and left me. I stood thunderstruck by the brief
and daring reply and by the flash of that clear gaze. She
had spoken the words without a smile.
</p>

<p>
She did not address me during the rest of the evening.
When she left, she barely glanced at me and vouchsafed neither
smile nor greeting.
</p>

<p>
Just for an instant she raised her black-fringed eyes and
gazed at me; then her lashes fell; and it was as if a light had
been blown out.
</p>

<p>
I am in love with her! Madly, divinely, desperately in love.
Ah, Stepan, love—what an ecstasy and what a disaster!
</p>

<p class="indr">
Your <span class="smcap">Bozevsky</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was Dr. Stahl, the “Satanic Stahl,” who got
these letters from his cousin Stepan Nebrasoff,
and showed them to me. They bewildered and
troubled me. What? Was I really so attractive
and so perturbing in the eyes of the gallant young
Pole—the handsomest officer in the Imperial
Guard? I repeated to myself his disquieting epithets:
“flower-like,” “ethereal,” “inscrutable”;
and in my room at night when I loosened my hair,
I wondered: “Does it really look like a cataract
of champagne?” When I went out I never smiled,
even when I felt inclined to do so, since my gravity
had seemed so charming to him.
</p>

<p>
Night and day he followed me like a shadow—or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
rather, should I say, like a blaze of light. In
whatever direction I turned I was sure to encounter
his radiant smile and his flashing glance.
His passion encompassed me; I felt like Brunnhilde
surrounded by a sea of flame. I was elated
yet terrified.
</p>

<p>
One evening at dinner I made up my mind to
speak to Vassili about it.
</p>

<p>
“Vassili,” I said falteringly, “I think we ought
to go away for a time.”
</p>

<p>
“Away? Where to?” asked my husband.
</p>

<p>
“Anywhere—anywhere away from Kieff.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
I felt myself turning pale! “I am afraid,” I
stammered, “I am afraid—that Bozevsky—”
</p>

<p>
“Well?” asked Vassili serenely, pouring some
vodka into his champagne and drinking it.
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid that Bozevsky is falling in love
with me.”
</p>

<p>
“And who would not fall in love with you,
dushka?” laughed Vassili. “As for Bozevsky,
may the wolves eat him.”
</p>

<p>
And dinner being over, he lit his cigar and went
out.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
I go sadly upstairs to the nursery where Tioka
and Tania, like blonde seraphs, lie asleep.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
A dim lamp hangs between the two white cots
and illumines their favorite picture—an artless
painting of the Virgin Mary, holding in her youthful
arms the infant Jesus with a count's coronet
on His head.
</p>

<p>
I kneel down beside the two little beds and
weep.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Sonia, rectilinear and asexual in her gray
flannel dressing-gown, comes in softly and bends
over me.
</p>

<p>
“You must trust in Providence,” she says, raising
towards the ceiling her long virginal face.
“And take a little camomile tea. That always
does one good.”
</p>

<p>
I obey her meekly and gratefully. It comforts
me to think that a day will come when I also shall
be like Aunt Sonia; when I also shall be content
to wear gray flannel dressing-gowns and turn in
my sorrows to Providence and to camomile tea.
</p>

<p>
And I wish that that day of peace were near.

</h2>

<p>
So we stayed on in Kieff and Bozevsky came
to see us every day. He brought me flowers—wonderful
orchids the color of amethyst, tenuous
contorted blossoms that looked as if they had
bloomed in some garden of dreams. He brought
me books; books of nebulous German poetry;
Spanish plays by Echegaray all heroism and fire;
and disquieting, neurotic French novels. Then he
brought me English books which filled me with
pleasant surprise. How far removed from our
Slav souls were those limpid Anglo-Saxon minds!
How child-like and simple was their wit, how
bland and practical their outlook on life. That
was the literature I liked best of all; perhaps because
it was so different from everything in myself.
I felt that I was a strange, ambiguous,
complicated creature compared with those candid
elemental natures.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky liked to find me reading. He would
arrive in the evening—usually after Vassili had
gone out, alone or with friends—and enter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the drawing-room with bright and cheerful greeting.
He always smiled when he found me with
one of his books in my hand, sitting beside Aunt
Sonia placidly knitting in her armchair.
</p>

<p>
“I like your thoughts to be far away from here,”
he would say, kissing my hand. “I like to know
that your soul is far from the frivolous society
you live in, far from the petty preoccupations,
the compliments and the flattery which surround
you. Let me read with you; let me join you
in the purer realm of fancy, far away from the
world.” And he would sit down beside me, with
an air of protecting fraternal affection.
</p>

<p>
One evening he found me nervous and agitated.
</p>

<p>
“What has happened?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“I have been reading a ghastly book,” I told
him with a shudder. “The story of a mysterious
plant, a sort of huge octopus that feeds on human
flesh—”
</p>

<p>
“Ugh!” laughed Bozevsky, “how gruesome!”
and he bent his sunny head over the page.
</p>

<p>
“Just imagine,” I continued, “its branches are
long moving tentacles, its thick leaves are quite
black and hard; they glitter and move like living
scorpions....”
</p>

<p>
“Horrid, horrid,” said Bozevsky with his shining
smile as he took the book out of my hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
“Forget the scorpions. To-night I shall read
you some Italian poetry. I want you to make
friends with Carducci.”
</p>

<p>
He opened a plainly bound volume at random,
and read to me.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“<i>Oh favolosi prati d'Eliseo</i>...”</p>
</div>

<p>
I forgot the tree of scorpions. I forgot Bozevsky.
I forgot Aunt Sonia and the world. The
unknown poet had wrapped my spirit in his giant
wings and was bearing me far away.
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that Vassili took me to
Moscow. There, one evening, our friends the
Maximoffs brought a stranger to see us. They
introduced him as an estimable Moscow lawyer
of high repute. I was surrounded by other
friends and I greeted him absently, without hearing
his name. I remember casually noticing that
he was neither young nor old, neither ugly nor
handsome. His wife, a timid, fair-haired woman,
was with him.
</p>

<p>
At Vassili's suggestion we all went to the
“Strelna,” a famous night-restaurant. I remember
that there was a great deal of laughter
at the grotesque jokes which Vassili and Maximoff
and also the estimable lawyer played on the pretty
dark-faced tziganes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
I noticed that the lawyer's wife did not laugh.
She passed her hand across her wistful Madonna-like
brow, and listened only to the music.
</p>

<p>
Like her I felt out of tune with the merriment
around me. My thoughts wandered back to the
silent drawing-room at Kieff: I thought of Aunt
Sonia and her peaceful knitting, of Bozevsky and
the books he had brought me. I seemed to hear
his voice saying, “Ugh! a tree of scorpions”—and
at that very instant something cold and claw-like
clutched my bare shoulder. I uttered a
piercing shriek, which seemed to turn every one—including
myself—cold with terror. But it was
only the estimable lawyer, who, having drunk
rather too much, had playfully climbed upon the
sofa behind me and, to save himself from falling
off, had laid his hand upon my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“What on earth has happened?” exclaimed
Vassili. “What made you scream like that?”
</p>

<p>
“I don't know,” I stammered, taken aback, “I
thought—I thought it was a scorpion!”
</p>

<p>
Every one laughed and for the rest of the evening
the lawyer was nicknamed “the Scorpion.”
Perhaps this name added to the unreasoning fear
I felt of him, or perhaps I was merely nervous,
but he seemed to be always close behind me, and
during the whole of that evening I kept on turning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
round, with little shivers running down my
spine, to see what he was doing.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he had disappeared. Vassili laughed
loudly. “Hullo! Where's the Scorpion?” And
amidst the laughter of the guests he set himself
to count the flippant tziganes one by one to see
if any were missing. But they were all there—and
I was glad for the sake of the Scorpion's poor
little Madonna-wife.
</p>

<p>
It was three in the morning when we went back
to our sleighs. It was very cold; the clear deep-blue
sky was powdered with stars. Assisted by
Maximoff I was about to step into the sleigh,
when, with another cry, I drew back; my foot had
touched something soft and shapeless that was
lying huddled up beneath the rug.
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter now?” cried Vassili.
“Another scorpion?”
</p>

<p>
No, it was the same one. It was the estimable
lawyer very drunk and fast asleep at the bottom
of the sleigh.
</p>

<p>
On our way back to the hotel, driving through
the keen night air, I asked Vassili:
</p>

<p>
“Who was that man?”
</p>

<p>
“What man?” said Vassili, who sat opposite
to us and was pressing the small feet of Maximoff's
wife.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
“You know—the man who frightened me.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, the Scorpion?” laughed Vassili. “That
was Donat Prilukoff.”
</p>

<p>
When we returned to Kieff I told Bozevsky the
adventure of our evening at the Strelna, and described
the Scorpion to him with as much humor
as I could. But Bozevsky did not laugh. My
absence had embittered and exasperated him.
He no longer sat beside me with an air of protective
fraternal affection. He would not speak of
literature or poetry any more. He spent entire
evenings making mute scenes of jealousy and
despair, while dear Aunt Sonia, instinctively
feeling the atmosphere around her charged with
electricity, dropped many stitches in her knitting
and became sour and irritable.
</p>

<p>
“My child, this must not go on any longer.
Either Alexis Bozevsky must be forbidden the
house or we ourselves must go away. I cannot
understand how Vassili—” Her honest cheeks
kindled with indignation. “Enough. I shall
speak to him about it myself.”
</p>

<p>
She did so: and Vassili, with his usual brief
comment that we all bored him to death, expressed
the hope that wild beasts might devour Bozevsky,
and ordered us to pack up and leave for the
country at once.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XII
</h2>

<p>
So we all left for the country—to the great
delight of Aunt Sonia and the children.
</p>

<p>
Let my mind linger for an instant on those
springtide days—the last for me, though I did not
know it, of unalloyed serenity. The children and
I used to rise at dawn and go into the vast garden
all a-shimmer with dew. On the glittering lawn,
among the flower-beds, down the shady avenues
of the park the two little elfin figures flitted before
me, calling to me, eluding me, darting to and fro
like twin will-o'-the-wisps; then turned and ran
towards me with wind-light steps and gilt locks
afloat, to shelter in my outstretched arms. Oh!
my children, my little boy and girl, when you remember
your mother I pray that God may lead
your memories back to those clear morning hours,
and may the rest be blotted out and dark.
</p>

<p>
Vassili was inexpressibly bored with rural solitude
and sought new means of diversion. His
latest fad was target-shooting. He filled the
house with rifles and revolvers and invited every
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
one in the neighboring country houses to take
part in shooting matches in our grounds. From
morning to night, in the garden, in the courtyard,
even from the windows of the house, there was a
ceaseless crackling of firearms.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon when the house was filled with
guests, Dr. Stahl and Bozevsky arrived in their
troika from the neighboring castle of the
Grigorievskys, where they had been staying. To
my astonishment, Vassili received them jubilantly
and embraced them both. He had quite forgotten
the reasons which had led to our departure from
Kieff.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky came to greet me at once, and for
the rest of the day never left my side. He enveloped
me in a whirlwind of ecstatic tenderness.
His infatuation, which he sought neither to conceal
nor to control, disquieted me deeply.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that his friend Dr. Stahl watched us
continually. I had not seen the doctor for many
months, and he struck me as strangely altered.
His very light eyes, in which the pupils were
contracted until they seemed mere pin-points,
followed me continuously.
</p>

<p>
“Doctor,” I said to him, “what strange eyes
you have! Just like the eyes of a cat when it
looks at the sun!”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
“I do not look at the sun,” he answered slowly,
speaking with great stress. “I look into an abyss,
the abyss of annihilation and oblivion. Some day,
if ever you are irremediably unhappy, come to
me and I will open to you, also, the doors of my
unearthly paradise—of this chasm of deadly joy
which engulfs me.”
</p>

<p>
“Shame on you, Stahl! How dare you suggest
such a thing!” exclaimed Bozevsky, casting a look
almost of hatred upon the morphinomaniac.
“Why must you and your kind always seek to
drag others down into your own gehenna?”
</p>

<p>
Stahl sighed. “It is terrible, I know. But it
is a characteristic of our malady.”
</p>

<p>
I listened without comprehending. I did not
then know of Stahl's enslavement to the drug.
“What are you speaking of? What malady? I
do not understand.”
</p>

<p>
“It is better not to understand,” murmured
Bozevsky with knitted brows. “Stahl is distraught;
he is ill. Pay no attention to him. And
never follow either his advice nor his example.
But pray,” he added, “do not worry your head
over anything we have said; the shooting match
will soon begin. I think your husband is looking
for you.”
</p>

<p>
But Vassili was far from troubling himself about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
me. He was rushing to and fro setting up rows
of bottles that were to serve as targets, and distributing
guns and cartridges to all our guests.
Then he hurried towards us. “There,” he said
to Dr. Stahl and to Bozevsky, giving them each a
Flobert rifle, “these are for you.”
</p>

<p>
“And what about the Countess?” asked Stahl
in his hollow voice. “Is she not going to compete
in the shooting?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no!” I exclaimed. “I am much too frightened.”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense!” cried Vassili, pushing a gun into
my unwilling hands. “Of course you must shoot
with the rest. And I warn you that if you are
not brave I shall play William Tell with an apple
on your head!” He passed on laughing, with
Madame Grigorievskaja armed with a Browning
by his side.
</p>

<p>
I was not at all brave; I held the rifle at arm's
length, trembling with fear lest it should explode
by itself. Stahl was amused by my terror, while
Bozevsky sought to encourage and comfort me.
</p>

<p>
“Poor timid birdling,” he murmured, “do not
be frightened. See, I will teach you. It is done
like this”—and he lifted the gun to my shoulder,
placed my hands in position, and with his glowing
face quite close to mine, showed me how I was to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
take aim. What with my terror of the gun and
the fragrance of his fair hair near my cheek I felt
quite dizzy.
</p>

<p>
“There, that's it. Now press the trigger.”
</p>

<p>
“No! no! Don't say that! don't let me!” I
screamed, incoherent with terror while Stahl and
Bozevsky laughed.
</p>

<p>
Vassili from a distance caught sight of me:
“Bravo, Mura!” he cried. “That's right. Go
on. Shoot!”
</p>

<p>
“No! no!” I cried with my eyes shut and
standing rigid in the position in which Bozevsky
had placed me, for I dared not move a muscle.
</p>

<p>
Vassili called impatiently: “What on earth
are you waiting for?”
</p>

<p>
Still motionless, I gasped:
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps—I might dare—if some one were to
cover my ears.”
</p>

<p>
Amidst great amusement Bozevsky came behind
me and placed his two hands over my ears.
</p>

<p>
“Come now!” cried Stahl. “Do not be frightened.”
</p>

<p>
“Mind you hit the third bottle,” shouted Vassili
from the distance.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky standing behind me was clasping my
head as though in a vice and whispering into my
hair: “Darling, darling, darling! I love you.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
“Don't,” I cried, almost in tears under the
stress of different emotions, “and don't hold my
ears so tight.”
</p>

<p>
The warm clasp relaxed at once.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, no!” I cried. “I can hear everything.
I don't want to hear—,” but even as I spoke the
gun went off. I felt a blow near my shoulder, and
thought I was wounded; but it was only the recoil
of the weapon.
</p>

<p>
Everybody was laughing and applauding.
</p>

<p>
“What have I killed?” I asked, cautiously
opening my eyes.
</p>

<p>
“The third bottle!” cried Vassili, and he was
so delighted with my exploit that he ran up and
embraced me. But the pistol he was holding in
his hand and Bozevsky's glance of jealous wrath
filled me afresh with twofold terror.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon passed as if in a dream. Vassili
became very much excited and drank a great deal
of vodka. Then Madame Grigorievskaja, who
had once visited the United States, concocted
strange American drinks which we had never
tasted before—cocktails, mint-juleps, pousse-cafés
and gin-slings. They were much approved of by
every one.
</p>

<p>
I remember vaguely that half way through the
afternoon some one let down my hair and set me
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
among the shattered bottles with an apple on my
head. I seem to see Vassili standing in front of
me with a rifle and taking aim at me while the
others utter cries of protest. Suddenly Bozevsky
snatches the weapon from my husband's hands,
and there is a brief struggle between them. Soon
they are laughing again, and shaking hands—then
Bozevsky joins me among the shattered bottles,
and stands in front of me; he is so tall that I can
see nothing but his broad shoulders and his fair
hair. And Vassili is shooting—the bullets whirr
over my head and all around me, but I have no
sense of fear; Bozevsky stands before me, straight
and motionless as a rampart.
</p>

<p>
We go in to dinner; gipsy musicians arrive and
play for us. Late at night when the garden is
quite dark we go out again to the targets; instead
of the bottles Vassili has ordered a row of lighted
candles to be set up, and we are to extinguish them
with our shots without knocking them down.
There is much noise around me; Vassili is dancing
a tarantelle with Ivan Grigorievsky on the lawn.
Dr. Stahl and Bozevsky are always by my side.
I keep on shooting at the candles, but they spin
round before my confused eyes like catharine-wheels;
and Stahl laughs, and Bozevsky sighs, and
the gipsies play....
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Suddenly Tioka's nurse comes hurriedly down
the pathway towards me.
</p>

<p>
“May I speak to your ladyship for a moment?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, Elise. What is it?”
</p>

<p>
“Master Tioka cannot go to sleep. He says
you have forgotten to bid him good-night.”
</p>

<p>
I put down my rifle and follow the straight small
figure of Elise Perrier through the garden. I
hasten after her into the house and upstairs to the
nursery.
</p>

<p>
Little Tania is already fast asleep, with scarlet
lips parted and silken hair scattered on her pillow.
But Tioka is sitting up in his cot awaiting me.
His bright soft eyes wander over my face, my
hair, my dress; his innocent gaze seems to pierce
me like a fiery sword. He holds out his arms to
me and I hide my flushed face on his childish
breast.
</p>

<p>
“Good-night, mother dear,” he whispers, kissing
me and patting my face with his small hand.
Then he adds, with a funny little sniff at my cheeks
and hair: “You smell of many things—of perfume
and powder and cigarettes and wine....”
</p>

<p>
This sequence of gay words on the childish lips
strikes at my heart like so many daggers.
</p>

<p>
“Hush, darling,” I whisper, taking refuge in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
those frail arms as in a haven of safety. “Forgive—forgive
your mother.”
</p>

<p>
But he does not know what there is to forgive;
and he laughs and yawns and then nestles down
in his pillow, still holding tightly to my hand.
</p>

<p>
“Must you go away?” he sighs, in a sleepy, endearing
voice.
</p>

<p>
“No, darling, no. I will stay with you.”
</p>

<p>
“Then tell me the poetry about the Virgin
Mary coming down to see us in the night.”
</p>

<p>
Holding my child's hand in my own, I begin
softly:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“When little children sleep, the Virgin Mary</p>
<p>Steps with white feet upon the crescent moon...”</p>
</div>

<p>
But already Tioka is in the land of dreams.
</p>

<h2>
XIII
</h2>

<p>
The whole party of guests stayed at our house
that night. Even one of the gipsy musicians was
found next morning asleep on the sofa in the
library.
</p>

<p>
No one came down to breakfast. Only Bozevsky
got up early and went for a gallop on the hills.
</p>

<p>
I awoke at eight o'clock and rang the bell.
Elise Perrier came in and opened the windows.
The fresh April breeze blew in and the chirrup of
the nests greeted me.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, is the morning fine? Can the mountains
be seen?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my lady.”
</p>

<p>
“Elise, when you see the mountains do you not
feel homesick for Switzerland?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my lady.” And Elise stooped down to
set out my slippers and to hide the flush that rose
to her face.
</p>

<p>
“I am homesick, too, Elise. I am homesick I
hardly know for what—homesick for solitude and
peace.”
</p>

<p>
She made no reply.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
“Should I find them in your Switzerland, do
you think?”
</p>

<p>
Elise Perrier shakes her head and answers in
a low tone: “No, my lady. Swiss homesickness
and Russian homesickness are different.”
</p>

<p>
“In what way?”
</p>

<p>
“We Swiss are homesick for—how shall I say?—for
the outside things we are far away from
... homesick for mountains and pine-trees and
villages. But Russians are homesick for what
they miss in their own hearts.”
</p>

<p>
“You are right, Elise.”
</p>

<p>
Tioka in his nightdress followed by Tania
sucking the head of her favorite rubber doll have
run gaily in and embrace me.
</p>

<p>
“Are we going to Switzerland?” cries Tioka,
who has overheard what we were saying. “How
nice! When do we start?”
</p>

<p>
“How nice! When do we start?” says Tania,
who always echoes everything her brother says.
</p>

<p>
“I like to be always going away,” adds Tioka.
</p>

<p>
And Tania repeats, “I like to be always going
away.”
</p>

<p>
I marvel at finding in these two children of mine,
my own unrest already stirring, like a butterfly
poised with quivering wings on the dawning
flower of their souls.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
I went down alone into the garden and entered
the grove, where the sunshine only penetrates
with mild rays of almost lunar whiteness. The
grass under my feet was studded with periwinkles,
their prim, pert faces lifted to the sky; tenuous
ferns unfolded their embroidered scrolls, and
masses of gentle wild violets, conscious of their
pallor and their scentlessness, drooped shyly in
the shade.
</p>

<p>
In the branches overhead wild hidden birds tried
their new springtide voices in soft modulations
and trills, or in long-drawn contralto notes of
liquescent sweetness. Thus April spoke to me
in gentle voices. With a sudden overwhelming
longing to be nearer to the very soul of spring, I
knelt on the grass and buried my face in the cool
leaves and blossoms, bidding my heart be pure
and cool as they.
</p>

<p>
On my homeward way I passed the targets.
The servants had put everything in order—pistols,
rifles and cartridges; and a fresh row of bottles
seemed to await with glassy eye the shots of the
amateur marksmen. With a deep sense of humiliation
I remembered the feverish agitations of
the previous day, and once more I said to myself:
“Henceforward may my life be serene and
pure.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
A gay voice rang out close behind me, and
startled me from my reverie.
</p>

<p>
“Lady Marie, good morrow!” It was Bozevsky,
who, clicking his spurred heels together,
saluted me with a radiant smile. His morning
canter seemed to have given him an added touch
of beauty and of daring; his fair hair gleamed in
the sunshine, his smile was reckless and resplendent.
</p>

<p>
I bowed without speaking and attempted to
pursue my way to the house, but he took my hand
and detained me.
</p>

<p>
“Why go in? Everybody is still asleep.
Come now,” he urged, with a frank engaging
smile, “stay here for awhile and practise at the
targets.”
</p>

<p>
So saying he chose a rifle and loaded it. Then
he held it out to me. I took it from him and put
it to my shoulder. I aimed carefully and was
about to press the trigger when suddenly Bozevsky,
with a lightning movement, put out his hand
and pressed his palm against the muzzle of my
gun.
</p>

<p>
“Wait!” he cried, with a wild, extravagant
laugh. “Wait a moment! Before you press
the trigger I want you to say—'Alexis, I love
you!'”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
“You are mad!” I exclaimed. “Take away
your hand!”
</p>

<p>
“No. First you must say—'Alexis, I love
you.'”
</p>

<p>
I felt a hot flush rise to my brow. “Take away
your hand!” I repeated and looked steadily at
him.
</p>

<p>
He did not move.
</p>

<p>
“Take it away, I implore you!”
</p>

<p>
Still he never moved, and I could see that hand
stopping the muzzle of my gun—a long, slender
hand with fingers separate and outstretched, and
I felt almost as if I were under the influence of
some hallucination. It was not only <i>his</i> hand that
I saw—I seemed in a kind of frenzy to see the
hands of all men outstretched before me, ready
to grasp me, to crush me, to beat me down. Doubtless
a wave of madness swept over me; a convulsive
spasm shook my wrist—and the gun went
off. I saw the long, lithe hand drop like some
wounded creature.
</p>

<p>
With a cry I let the rifle fall, and covered my
face. But Bozevsky had sprung upon me, and
with his other hand seized both mine and pressed
them down. He was as white as death. “You
little tigress,” he gasped. Then, as I was about
to cry out again, he covered my mouth with his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
shattered hand, and I felt the blood gush over my
face.
</p>

<p>
What distant heritage of madness broke upon
us at that moment? What primitive frenzy
lashed us together in a fierce embrace? I cannot
tell. All I know is that from that hour I was his—tamed,
vanquished, broken in spirit, and yet
glad. He was the first, the last, the only lover
of my devastated youth, and by his side the brief
springtime of my happiness flowered and died.
When the fearful death that was so soon to lay
him low came upon him, when I saw him fall
at my feet shot by Vassili—my reason gave way.
The rest of my life lies behind me like a somber
nightmare landscape, through which I wander,
groping in the dark, stumbling forward on my way
to perdition....
</p>

<p>
Yet sometimes I dream that it is all not true,
that he still lives, that one day the door of my
cell will open, and the lover of my youth appear
to me again. I shall see him standing on the
threshold, a halo of sunshine lighting his fair hair,
like some young martyr-saint come to deliver me
from my bondage. The hand I wounded will be
filled with roses, and his clear voice will call me by
my name.
</p>

<p>
Then rising from this gloomy prison bench I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
shall move to meet him. Shame and crime and
captivity will fall away from me like a dark and
worn-out cloak.
</p>

<p>
Free and fair as in those distant April days in
which he loved me, with white, winged footsteps
I shall follow him.
</p>

</p>

<h2>
XIV
</h2>

<p>
Suddenly, almost from one day to another,
Vassili grew jealous. When I had adored him
he had neglected and forsaken me. Now that he
feared to lose me he was inconsolable.
</p>

<p>
“You and Tioka are very much alike,” I said
to him one day when we were all at luncheon.
</p>

<p>
“Do you think so?” said Vassili, patting his
little son's fair head and contemplating the small
face, which at that moment was making a terrible
grimace over its food. “What makes you say
so?”
</p>

<p>
“You shall see.” I leaned over to the child.
“Tioka, my darling, won't you eat your nice dinner?”
</p>

<p>
“No!” said Tioka with great decision.
</p>

<p>
“Come, now, darling, eat your nice soup,” and
I held a spoonful to his lips.
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Tioka, turning his face away.
</p>

<p>
“Why not, dear? Don't you like it?”
</p>

<p>
“No. It's nasty.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, then,” I said, putting down the spoon,
“we will give it to the farmer's little boy.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
“No! no!” cried Tioka, and he quickly devoured
the soup in large spoonfuls.
</p>

<p>
Vassili laughed. “He is quite right. His
soup is not for the farmer's little boy. To each
one his own soup, isn't that so, Tioka!”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Tioka.
</p>

<p>
“Why 'no'? You should say 'yes.'”
</p>

<p>
“No,” declared Tioka doggedly. “This is my
'no' day.”
</p>

<p>
“Your <i>what</i>?” exclaimed his father.
</p>

<p>
“My day for saying 'no,'” announced Tioka
with great decision.
</p>

<p>
His father was much amused. “I also shall
have my 'no' days,” he declared. “And I shall
begin at once. To-day, Mura, we shall receive
no visitors.”
</p>

<p>
“But, Vassili,” I protested, “we must see the
Grigorievskys; we have invited them to dinner.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said my husband.
</p>

<p>
“And Semenzoff. And Bozevsky.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” he repeated.
</p>

<p>
“Do you really mean that we are not to receive
them?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” he reiterated. “This is my 'no' day.”
And the reception for that evening was actually
put off. The jest seemed highly entertaining to
Vassili. I heard him laughing to himself as he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
went downstairs; and in the days that followed
he frequently repeated it.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards he took us all back to Kieff
and there he had many “no” days. In particular
he would not let Bozevsky visit us; and more than
a month passed without my seeing him.
</p>

<p>
At last it happened that the Stahls invited us
to a ball, and Vassili, who chanced to be in a good
temper, accepted. I knew I should meet Bozevsky
there, and at the mere thought of seeing him
again I trembled with joy and fear.
</p>

<p>
Elise Perrier dressed me in a filmy gossamer
gown of soft opalescent tints, and fastened
round my neck the famous O'Rourke pearls—those
pearls which, according to family traditions,
had once decorated the slender neck of Mary
Stuart.
</p>

<p>
As Vassili put me into the troika he was all
kindness and amiability; he wrapped me closely
in the furs, and then took his seat beside me,
muffling himself up to his nose in the bearskins.
The horses started and we were off like the
wind.
</p>

<p>
During the drive tender and kindly feelings
towards Vassili filled my heart. I said to myself
that perhaps he was after all not wholly to
blame for his faults and follies. He, too, was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
so young; perhaps if I had been less of a child
at the time of my marriage I should have known
how to make him love me more. And, after all,
were we not still in time to reshape our lives?
What if we were to go far away from Kieff, far
from St. Petersburg, and try to take up the thread
of our broken idyll again? My hand sought his.
He grasped it and held it warmly clasped under
the rug without turning towards me; I could
see his eyes shining under his fur cap as he gazed
straight before him, while we sped over the silent
snow. During that drive, from the bottom of
my heart, I forgave him all his transgressions
and silently craved forgiveness for mine. Already
I seemed to see myself with him and the children
and Aunt Sonia happily secluded in some smiling
rose-clad mansion in Italy. He would take up
the study of his music again, perhaps he would
compose, as he had often spoken of doing—while
I, seated at his feet, would read the Italian poets
that I loved, raising my eyes now and then to contemplate
the motionless blue wave of the distant
Apennines....
</p>

<p>
But the troika had stopped, and Vassili sprang
out upon the snow. Through the illuminated
windows the tzigane music poured forth its waves
of sensuous melody—and alas! the rhythmic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
swing of it swept away, as in a whirlwind, the
peaceful dreams of Italy, of the rose-clad mansion
and the Italian poets.
</p>

<p>
While the servants were taking our cloaks and
snowshoes from us I whispered hurriedly to
Vassili: “Dearest, be good to-night. Do not
drink much.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not? What a strange idea!” he said;
and we passed into the overheated, overlighted
rooms.
</p>

<p>
At the far end of the ballroom some thirty
tziganes, women and men, in their picturesque
costumes were making music. The men played
and the women sang. The dancing couples
whirled round in the scent-laden air.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Stahl's wife, a kindly German woman,
received us with amiable smiles; Stahl himself
greeted us with excited effusiveness. He was
quite pale with two red spots on the summit of
his cheeks. I was struck anew by his strange
air of intoxication, for I knew he never touched
wine. Immediately, from the end of the room
Bozevsky came hastening to meet us, superb in
his full uniform—blue tunic and scarlet belt.
</p>

<p>
“Hail <i>Fata Morgana</i>!” he cried. “Give me
this dance,” and he put his arm round my waist.
But I drew back.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
“Alas, Prince Charming, I dare not.”
</p>

<p>
He turned pale; then he bowed, twirled on his
heels and moved away. He did not come near me
again until late in the evening. I saw him surrounded
by women, who danced with him, smiling
into his face, floating with languid grace in his arms.
</p>

<p>
I shrank into a corner of the vast room where
tall plants and flowers screened me from the
dancers.
</p>

<p>
“Why, what are you doing hidden here?” cried
Stahl, coming up to me. His pupils were narrower
than ever and his breath came and went
in short gasps. He bent over me and scanned
my face. “What are your thoughts, Countess
Marie?”
</p>

<p>
“I have no thoughts,” I replied sadly.
</p>

<p>
“Then I will give you one,” said he laughing;
“a blithe and comforting thought—think that a
hundred years hence we shall all be dead!”
</p>

<p>
“True,” I answered, and a wave of unspeakable
melancholy invaded my soul. “We may, perhaps,
be dead even fifty years hence.”
</p>

<p>
“Or thirty,” laughed Stahl.
</p>

<p>
“Or twenty,” I sighed, in even deeper despondency.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no,” said Stahl. “Twenty years hence
you will still be a charming matron getting on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
towards middle-age.” And, as some one was calling
him, he turned away and left me.
</p>

<p>
His words sank into my heart, heavy and searing
as molten lead. How short, how short was life!
How the years flew past! How brief were the
wings of youth and happiness! I raised my eyes—doubtless
they were full of sadness—and I
saw that Bozevsky at the far end of the room
was looking at me. Several brilliantly attired
women were laughing and talking to him, but abruptly,
without excuse or explanation, he left them
and crossed the room to where I sat.
</p>

<p>
The tziganes were playing a wild, nerve-thrilling
czarda. Without a word Bozevsky put his
arm round me and drew me into the dance.
</p>

<p>
The music went faster and faster, wilder and
ever more wild.
</p>

<p>
Light as air I swung round in Bozevsky's arm.
I could have wished to dance thus forever—dance,
dance to the very brink of life and, still dancing,
to plunge over into the abyss of death.
</p>

<p>
As we whirled round I perceived that Vassili
was watching us. He was drinking champagne
with vodka in it and was laughing loudly while
he spoke to Stahl; but his eyes never left me as
I swept round the ballroom with Bozevsky. His
gaze alarmed me. I was dizzy and out of breath,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
but I did not dare to stop dancing for fear of
Vassili. I danced and danced, breathless and
distraught; I felt my heart beating furiously, pulsing
with the mad rapidity, the battering throb of
a motor-cycle at full speed—and still I danced
and danced on, while the ballroom, the guests,
the tziganes spun round and round before my
blurred eyes....
</p>

<p>
Vassili's gaze still followed me.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XV
</h2>

<p>
Suddenly my strength failed me. The room
seemed to be paved with water; the floor yielded
and undulated under my feet; the motor-cycle
pulsing in my breast stopped dead. Then I felt
Bozevsky's arm sustain me as I fell forward
on his breast. Everything whirled, darkened—vanished.
</p>

<p>
When I opened my eyes I was seated near the
window; the dancers crowded round me. Stahl
was bending over me with a small shining instrument
in his hand. It was a hypodermic syringe.
</p>

<p>
I shrank back in terror. “No, no!” I cried.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that I had recovered my senses Vassili,
who stood behind me, laid an iron hand on my
bare shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“Come,” he said in a hoarse and brutal voice.
“Come at once.”
</p>

<p>
“Where to?” I rose trembling to my feet. I
still felt dizzy and weak, and scarcely knew where
I was.
</p>

<p>
“Home,” said Vassili, bending over me with a
terrible look. His face was so close to mine that
I could feel his breath upon me, hot and laden
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
with that subtle sweetish exhalation of ether that
vodka leaves behind it. “The dance is over,” he
muttered. “It is over, it is over.” I noticed his
clenched fists; and I was afraid. A deep silence
had fallen on the entire room. “Come!” he repeated
in a tone that made me quake.
</p>

<p>
I shrank back in terror. Then Vassili put out
his hand and seized my pearl necklace; it broke
in his grasp. The milky gems fell to the ground
and rolled away in all directions; the guests, both
men and women, stooped down to search for them
and pick them up.
</p>

<p>
But now Bozevsky had taken a step forward,
and stood, haughty and aggressive, in front of
Vassili. He uttered a brief word in a low
voice.
</p>

<p>
Vassili turned upon him with livid countenance.
“Insolent scoundrel!” he cried, wildly searching
his pockets for a weapon; then in a frenzy he
turned on the awe-stricken assembly: “Go away,
everybody!” he shouted. “Stahl, turn out the
lights. We are going to have a game of blind
man's buff, the Uhlan and I. A game of blind
man's buff in the dark! Quick, Stahl, give us a
couple of revolvers. Send all these people away
and turn out the lights.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
He was beside himself with vodka and with
wrath.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky still faced him, calm and unmoved.
“Why should it be in the dark, Count Tarnowsky?
Why not in the light of day—at ten
paces?”
</p>

<p>
“No!” roared Vassili. “I'll kill you in the
dark, evil beast that you are. I'll slaughter you
like a wild beast in the dark!”
</p>

<p>
I never knew how we succeeded in getting him
out into the troika, but at last the feat was accomplished,
and he drove off with Madame Grigorievska
and Semenzoff, the only two people who
had any influence over him. I followed in another
sleigh, alone with Dr. Stahl, who during the entire
drive panted and shivered beside me, as if in the
throes of some fierce physical agony.
</p>

<p>
Through the starry calm of the night, while the
sleighs glided silently over the snow, we could
hear Vassili's strident and drunken voice still
roaring: “Blind man's buff with the officer!
Ha, ha, ha! In the dark—bing bang. Blind
man's buff!”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The scandal in Kieff was enormous. The whole
town spoke of nothing else. All the women sided
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
with Vassili, and all the men with me. As for
Vassili, he cared nothing for the opinion of either.
He came and went with lowering brows, never
speaking either to me or to the children.
</p>

<p>
I was unspeakably frightened and unhappy.
At last, one evening, unable to endure the strain
of his silence any longer, and praying God to give
me courage, I went tremblingly and knocked at
his study door.
</p>

<p>
He said “Come in,” and I entered.
</p>

<p>
He was standing by the window, smoking, and
he turned upon me a cold vindictive eye.
</p>

<p>
“Vassili”—my voice trembled—“Vassili, don't
be angry with me any more. Forgive me. I did
not mean to offend you. I did not mean—” I
burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
He seemed somewhat moved and held out his
hand to me without speaking.
</p>

<p>
I grasped it eagerly. He continued to smoke
and look out of the window, while I stood awkwardly
beside him, holding his hand and not knowing
what to say.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps my silence pleased him, for soon I felt
him press my trembling fingers more closely.
Looking timidly up into his face I saw that his
lips were quivering.
</p>

<p>
“Vassili,” I whispered.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
He turned to me abruptly. “Let us go away,”
he said, “Mura, let us go away!”
</p>

<p>
“Where?” I asked, overcome with sudden fear.
</p>

<p>
“Far away from here, far away from Russia.
I cannot live in this accursed country any longer.”
And Vassili let go my hand in order to clench his
fists.
</p>

<p>
“I had thought of it, too,” I said unsteadily.
And in a low voice I told him my thoughts of the
rose-clad house in Italy, my dreams of an azure
exile in that beauteous land, alone with him and
the children.
</p>

<p>
“Mura! Mura!” he said, taking my face
between his hands and gazing deeply into my eyes.
“Tell me—is it not too late?”
</p>

<p>
Was it too late?
</p>

<p>
In my soul my unlawful passion for Bozevsky
rose like a giant wave, towered over me, enveloped
and submerged me. Then—then to the eyes of
my spirit there came the vision of my children,
of a flower-filled Italian garden, of peace reconquered
and deliverance from evil. “No, Vassili,
no. It is not too late!”
</p>

<p>
With a sigh I lay my cheek against his shoulder
and bowed my face upon his breast.
</p>

<p>
Before our departure from Russia, in order not
to leave ill-feeling or evil talk behind us, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
decided that Vassili and Bozevsky should meet
and be reconciled.
</p>

<p>
The Stahls and Grigorievskys gladly undertook
to organize an afternoon reception at which we
were to take leave of all our friends and acquaintances.
After that there would be a theater party
at the opera, and, finally, the more intimate of
our friends were to be the guests of Bozevsky
himself at a supper at the Grand Hotel. There
we were to say farewell to one another for many
years, perhaps forever.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the burning desire which drew me
towards Bozevsky, I had honorably kept my part
of the agreement and had refused to see him for
even an instant before the appointed day.
</p>

<p>
Vassili took the necessary steps to get our passports
and every preparation was made for our
final departure from Russia.
</p>

<p>
And now the eve of our journey had come—the
afternoon reception was over; and this was the
fatal evening which was to mark the supreme and
ultimate hour of my happiness.
</p>

<p>
Satins and jewels decked my aching heart;
flowers garlanded my ringleted hair; I wanted
Alexis to see me for the last time looking my
fairest. I longed to remain forever in his memory
a loved and radiant vision.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
“You are dazzlingly beautiful,” said my cousin
Vera to me, as soon as I entered the room, surveying
me from top to toe. “I can quite understand
why every one is crazy about you.”
</p>

<p>
I was immediately surrounded by all our most
intimate friends, who lamented in every key our
resolve to leave Russia.
</p>

<p>
“Without you, Kieff will be empty. It will be
like a ring which has lost its brightest gem.”
</p>

<p>
I smiled and sighed, feeling both gratified and
mournful.
</p>

<p>
Who would have thought that after this evening
all those who now surrounded me with flattering
words would pass me by without a greeting, would
turn from me as from some vile and tainted creature?
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky, pallid and stern, came to me, and
bowed low as he kissed my hand.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Ave! Ave ... Maria!</i>” he said. Then he
raised his eyes and looked at me long and fixedly.
Despair was so clearly written on his countenance,
that I felt afraid lest Vassili should notice it;
Alexis read the fear in my eyes, and laughed.
“Do you know what I believe?” he said.
</p>

<p>
I looked at him without understanding.
</p>

<p>
“I believe,” he continued in scornful tones,
“that I am in a trap.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
“A trap? What do you mean?” I gazed
questioningly into his face.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, a trap,” said he with a cynical laugh.
Then in a tone that seemed in keeping with the
frivolous atmosphere that surrounded us:
</p>

<p>
“Countess,” he continued, “has it ever happened
to you to go wrong in some well-known quotation?
To begin, for instance, with one author,
and to end with another?”
</p>

<p>
“I do not understand,” I stammered, perplexed
by the strangeness of his manner. “What—what
do you mean?”
</p>

<p>
Vassili was approaching, and Alexis with a
scornful laugh raised his voice slightly as he spoke.
“Because to-night,” he said, “a misquotation of
that kind keeps ringing through my brain. “<i>Ave,
Maria!... Morituri te salutant!</i>”
</p>

<p>
Vassili stood beside us and heard the words with
a puzzled smile.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Morituri?</i>” he said, holding out his hand to
Bozevsky with a frank and friendly gesture.
“<i>Morituri?</i> Indeed I hope not.”
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky took his hand and looked him in the
face. Vassili returned his gaze; then, with an
impulsive gesture, in true Russian fashion, my
husband bent forward and kissed him on both
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
No! no, it was not a trap! From the depths
of my broken heart, from my inmost consciousness,
there springs up this protest on behalf of
him who on that fatal evening wrecked my life.
I know that it was an impulse of his fervent heart
that impelled Vassili to open his arms to the man
whom an hour before he had hated—and whom an
hour later he slew.
</p>

<p>
No; it was not a trap.
</p>

</p>

<h2>
XVI
</h2>

<p>
Doubtless that evening I was beautiful. During
the supper party at the Grand Hotel I felt
that I diffused around me an atmosphere of more
subtle intoxication than the music or the wines.
Placed between Vassili and Stahl I laughed and
laughed in a fever of rapturous gaiety. I was excited
and overwrought.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky sat facing me. As I glanced at his
proud, passionate face, I said in my heart: “To-morrow
you will see him no more. But this
evening he is here; you see him, pale for the love
of you, thrilled by your presence. Do not think
of to-morrow. To-morrow is far away!”
</p>

<p>
So I laughed and laughed while the rhythmic
charm of waltzes played on muted strings wrought
upon my senses, swaying me towards an unreal
world, a world of transcendent passion and incomparable
joys.
</p>

<p>
Stahl, seated at my right hand, was flushed and
elated, but still drew the hurried sibilant breaths
I had so often noticed in him. Vassili seemed to
have fallen in love with me anew. He murmured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
rapturous words into my ear. “To-morrow you
shall be mine, mine only, out of reach of all others,
beyond the sight and the desire of all these people—whose
necks I should like to wring.” And he
drank his Clicquot looking at me with kindling
eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Vassili,” I whispered imploringly, “do not
drink any more.”
</p>

<p>
“Don't you wish me to?” he asked, turning
to me with his glass of champagne in his hand.
“Don't you wish it? Well—there!” He flung
the glass full of blonde wine behind him over his
shoulder. The thin crystal chalice was shattered
into a thousand pieces.
</p>

<p>
“What are you doing, Vassili? What are you
doing?” cried Grigorievsky. “Are you playing
the King of Thule?”
</p>

<p>
“Precisely,” laughed Vassili. “Was he not the
paragon of all lovers, who chose to die of thirst
in order to follow his adored one to the grave?”
</p>

<p>
And somewhat uncertainly he quoted:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“Then did he fling his chalice</p>
<p>Into the surging main,</p>
<p>He watched it sink and vanish—</p>
<p class="i2">  And never drank again.”</p>
</div>

<p>
“Here's to the King of Thule!” cried one of
the guests. And they all drank Vassili's health.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Bozevsky had sprung to his feet; his eyes
gleamed strangely. “You may be the King of
Thule, Tarnowsky,” he cried in a mocking tone,
“but I am the knight Olaf. You know the
legend?” His clear insolent eyes surveyed the
guests provocatively. “Olaf—you remember—was
condemned to death for daring to love the
king's daughter. He was at his last banquet.
'Take heed, Olaf,' said the king. 'The headsman
stands at the door!' 'Let him stay there, sire,
while I bid farewell to life in a last toast!' And
standing up—just as I stand here—he raised his
glass, as I raise mine:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>“I drink to the earth, I drink to the sky,</p>
<p class="i2">  I drink to the sea and the shore;</p>
<p>I drink to the days that I have seen,</p>
<p class="i2">  And the days I shall see no more;</p>
<p>I drink to the King who has sentenced me,</p>
<p class="i2">  And the Headsman at the door.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>“I bless the joys that I have had</p>
<p class="i2">  And the joys that I have missed;</p>
<p>I bless the eyes that have smiled on me</p>
<p class="i2">  And the lips that I have kissed!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Here Bozevsky turned and looked straight at
me:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“To <i>thy</i> red lips that I have kissed</p>
<p>I raise this cup of wine,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>
<p>I bless thy radiant loveliness</p>
<p class="i2">  That made my life divine,</p>
<p>And I bless the hour that brings me death</p>
<p class="i2">  For the hour that thou wert mine!”</p>
</div>

<p>
He uttered these words in a loud voice, with
his daring eyes fixed steadily on mine; then he
raised his glass and drained it.
</p>

<p>
Vassili had sprung to his feet. But instantly
Stahl was beside him, speaking rapidly, while
Grigorievsky exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
“The sleighs are waiting. It is time to go
home!”
</p>

<p>
Amid nervous and hurried farewells the perilous
moment passed and the danger was averted. We
all hastened to our sleighs; my cousin Vera and
Madame Grigorievska were beside me; Stahl and
Grigorievsky had each with an air of easy friendliness
taken my husband by the arm.
</p>

<p>
“Good-by! Good-by! <i>Bon voyage!</i> Good-by!”
The last farewells had been exchanged.
The impatient horses were shaking their bells in
the icy night air. Vera had already taken her
place in the sleigh, and I was about to step in beside
her, when I saw Bozevsky striding rapidly
towards me. He passed in front of my husband,
who was standing near the second sleigh with
Stahl and Grigorievsky, and came straight to me.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
He stretched out his hand with a gesture of
despair.
</p>

<p>
“So it is all over—all over!” he said. “And
this is good-by!”
</p>

<p>
His voice broke, and he bent his fair head over
my hand, crushing my fingers in his feverish
clasp.
</p>

<p>
At that instant the report of a shot rang out,
followed by a mad outburst of laughter from
Vassili. I saw the horses of the sleigh plunge
and rear.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky, still clasping my hand, wrenched himself
upright; a convulsive shiver passed through
him, and his head jerked backwards with a strange,
wooden movement like that of a broken doll—then
with a shrill burst of laughter which showed all
his teeth, he fell forward at my feet.
</p>

<p>
With a cry I bent over him, and I felt a splash
of blood on my face. It spurted forth like the
jet of a fountain from the side of his neck. Once
again my hands, my dress were covered with his
blood—I thought I was in a dream. Every one
had come rushing up. Now they raised him. I
saw Stahl snatch a white scarf from some one's
shoulders and wind it round and round the
wounded neck, and immediately a dark stain appeared
on the scarf and slowly widened.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Supported by Stahl, Bozevsky stared about him
with haggard eyes, until his gaze met mine.
</p>

<p>
A quiver passed over his face. “I bless the
hour—” he gasped. Then a gush of blood came
from his mouth, and he was silent.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XVII
</h2>

<p>
Bozevsky was carried to his room and the
manager and servants of the Grand Hotel
thronged in murmuring consternation round his
door. A Swedish doctor, staying at the hotel, was
summoned in haste. He appeared in his dressing-gown,
and with Stahl's assistance carefully
dressed and bound up the deep double wound
caused by the bullet, which had passed through
the left side of Bozevsky's neck and come out beneath
his chin.
</p>

<p>
Trembling and weeping I followed the sinister
procession, and with Cousin Vera and Madame
Stahl entered Bozevsky's room. Now I stood,
silently praying, at the foot of the bed. Bozevsky
sunken in his pillow, with his eyes closed and his
head and neck in bandages, looked as if he were
already dead.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly opened his eyes, and his gaze
wandered slowly from side to side until it rested
on me. He moved his lips as if to speak, and I
hastened to his pillow and bent over him.
</p>

<p>
He whispered, “Stay here.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
“Yes,” I said, and sat down beside him, taking
his moist, chill hand between my own.
</p>

<p>
He repeated weakly: “Stay here. Do not go
away.”
</p>

<p>
The Swedish doctor was washing his hands and
talking in a low voice to Stahl. He turned to me
and said:
</p>

<p>
“You must try not to agitate him. Do not let
him speak or move his head.” Then he went out
into the corridor with Stahl.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Stahl and Vera sat mute and terror-stricken
in a corner. I watched Bozevsky, with
a deep, dull ache racking my heart. He seemed
to be falling asleep. I felt his hand relax in mine
and his short breathing became calmer and more
regular.
</p>

<p>
But Stahl came in again, and Bozevsky opened
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Stahl approached the bedside and stood for a
long while looking down at his friend. Then he
turned to me. “A nurse is coming,” he said. “I
will take you ladies home and then come back and
pass the night with him.”
</p>

<p>
Take me home! How could I return home?
How could I endure to meet Vassili again? At
the mere thought of seeing him, who with a
treacherous shot from behind had shattered this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
young existence, hatred and terror flamed up
within me. No! I would not return home.
Never again would I touch the hand of Vassili
Tarnowsky.
</p>

<p>
While these thoughts traversed my mind, some
one knocked at the door. It was the nurse. Vera
and Madame Grigorievska, after questioning me
with their eyes, got up softly; then, with a glance
of pity at Bozevsky, they went on tiptoe out of the
room.
</p>

<p>
At the door Stahl beckoned to me to come. But
I shook my head. As if he knew what was passing
Bozevsky opened his eyes again.
</p>

<p>
“Stay here,” he whispered. Then he put his
hand to the bandage round his neck. “If you
leave me I will tear it all off.” He made a gesture
as if he would do so.
</p>

<p>
“I shall not leave you,” I whispered bending
over him. “I shall never leave you again.”
</p>

<p>
I kept my word.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Later I learned that Vassili had given himself
up to the authorities, and that my grief-stricken
mother had come to fetch our children and had
taken them with her to Otrada. To her and to
my father they were the source of much melancholy
joy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Thus did the old garden of my youth open
again its shadowy pathways and flowery lawns
to the unconscious but already sorrow-touched
childhood of little Tioka and Tania—those tragic
children whose father was in prison and whose
mother, far away from them, watched and suffered
by the sinister death-bed of a stranger. To me
the two innocent, angelic figures often came in
my dreams; and I cried out to them with bitterest
tears: “Oh, my own children, my two loved ones,
forgive your mother that she does not forsake one
who is dying for her sake. This very night, perhaps,
or to-morrow—soon, soon, alas!—his life will
end. And with a broken heart your mother will
return to you.”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
But Bozevsky did not die that night. Nor the
following day. Nor the day after.
</p>

<p>
Fate had in store for him and for me a much
more appalling doom. He dragged his frightful
death-agony through the interminable hours of a
hundred days and a hundred nights. He was
doomed to trail his torment from town to town,
from surgeon to surgeon, from specialist to charlatan.
One after another, they would unbandage
the white and withered neck, probe the blue-edged
wound, and then cover up again with yellow gauze
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the horrifying cavity; leaving us to return, heart-stricken
and silent, to the luxurious hotels that
housed our irremediable despair.
</p>

<p>
About that time I heard that Vassili had been
released on bail. Later on he was acquitted by
a jury in the distant city of Homel, on the ground
of justifiable homicide.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was a just verdict. But for him
whom he had struck down—and for me—what anguish,
great Heavens! What lingering torture of
heart-breaking days and nights.
</p>

<p>
Ah, those nights, those appalling nights! We
dreaded them as one dreads some monstrous wild
beast, lurking in wait to devour us. All day long
we thought only of the night. As soon as twilight
drew near Bozevsky, lying in his bed with his face
towards the window, clutched my hand and would
not let it go.
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid,” he would murmur. “I wish it
were not night. If only it were not night!”
</p>

<p>
“Nonsense, dearest,” I would say, cheerfully.
“It is quite early. It is still broad daylight.
Everybody is moving about. The whole world is
awake and out of doors.”
</p>

<p>
But night, furtive and grim, crouched in the
shadowy room, lurked in dark corners, and then
suddenly was upon us, black, silent, terrifying.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Round us the world lay asleep, and we two were
awake and alone with our terror.
</p>

<p>
Then began the never-ending question, ceaselessly
repeated, reiterated throughout the entire
night:
</p>

<p>
“<i>What is the time?</i>”
</p>

<p>
It was only nine o'clock. It was half-past nine....
Ten... Half-past ten... A quarter to
eleven... Eleven o'clock... Five minutes
past...
</p>

<p>
As soon as it was dawn, at about four o'clock,
Bozevsky grew calm. Silence fell, and he slept.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The last station of our calvary was at Yalta,
in the Crimea. We had gone there with a last
up-flaming of hope. There were doctors there
whom we had not yet consulted. There was
Ivanoff and the world-famed Bobros.
</p>

<p>
“Continue the same treatment,” said the one.
</p>

<p>
“You must try never to move your head,” said
the other.
</p>

<p>
That was all.
</p>

<p>
And to our other tortures was added the martyrdom
of complete immobility.
</p>

<p>
“I want to turn my head,” Bozevsky would say
in the night.
</p>

<p>
“No, dearest, no. I implore you—”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
“I must. I must turn it from one side to the
other. If I stay like this any longer I shall go
mad!”
</p>

<p>
Then, with infinite precautions, with eyes staring
and terror-filled, like one who yields to an overwhelming
temptation or performs some deed of
insane daring, Bozevsky would turn his sad face
slowly round, and let his cheek sink into the pillow.
</p>

<p>
His fair curls encircled with flaxen gaiety his
spent and desolate face.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XVIII
</h2>

<p>
Alone with him during those long terrible
hours, my anguish and my terror constantly increased.
At last I could endure it no longer and
I telegraphed to Stahl:
</p>

<p>
“Come immediately.”
</p>

<p>
At dusk the following day Stahl arrived.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped to derive courage and consolation
from his presence. But as soon as he stepped
upon the threshold my heart turned faint within
me. Thinner and more spectral than ever, with
hair dishevelled and eyes sunken and dull, he
looked dreamily at me, while a continual tremor
shook his hands.
</p>

<p>
I greeted him timorously, and the touch of his
chill, flaccid fingers made me shudder.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky seemed glad to see him. Stretching
out his wasted hand to him he said at once:
</p>

<p>
“Stahl, I want to move my head.”
</p>

<p>
Stahl seemed not to understand, and Bozevsky
repeated: “I want to turn my head from one side
to another.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
“Why not?” said Stahl, sitting down beside the
bed and lighting a cigarette. “Turn it by all
means.”
</p>

<p>
It was growing late; outside it was already dark.
I drew the curtains and turned on the lights.
Bozevsky began very slowly to turn his head from
side to side; at first very timorously with frightened
eyes, then by degrees more daringly, from
right to left and from left to right.
</p>

<p>
“Keep still, keep still, dearest,” I entreated,
bending over him.
</p>

<p>
“Stahl said it would not hurt,” panted Bozevsky.
“Did you not, Stahl?” Stahl made no
reply. He was smoking, with his heavy eyes half
closed. At the sight of him I was filled with loathing
and fear.
</p>

<p>
“Have you dined?” I inquired of him after a
long silence. He nodded and went on smoking.
</p>

<p>
I tried to coax Bozevsky to take an egg beaten
up in milk, but he continued to turn his head from
side to side and would touch nothing. Little by
little the sounds in the hotel died away. The gipsy
music which had been audible, faintly in the distance,
ceased. Night crept upon us sinister and
silent.
</p>

<p>
Presently Stahl roused himself and opened his
eyes. He looked at me and then at Bozevsky, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
lay in the circular shadow cast by the lamp shade,
dozing with his mouth slightly open; he looked
pitiful and grotesque in his collar of yellow gauze.
</p>

<p>
Stahl made a grimace; then his breath became
short and hurried as on that night of the ball when
he sat beside me in the sleigh. He was panting
with a slight sibilant sound and with a quick nervous
movement of his head.
</p>

<p>
“Stahl,” I whispered, leaning towards him and
indicating Bozevsky, “tell me—how do you think
he is?”
</p>

<p>
Stahl did not answer. He seemed not to have
heard me, but to be absorbed in some mysterious
physical suffering of his own.
</p>

<p>
“What is the matter, Stahl? What is the matter?
You are frightening me.”
</p>

<p>
With a nervous twist of his lips intended for a
smile Stahl got up and began to walk up and down
the room. His breath was still short and hurried.
He drew the air through his teeth like one who is
enduring spasms of pain.
</p>

<p>
Then he began to talk to himself in a low voice.
“I can wait,” he said under his breath. “I can
wait a little longer. Yes—yes—yes, I can wait a
little longer.”
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky had opened his eyes and was watching
him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Horror held me motionless and shivers ran like
icy water down my spine.
</p>

<p>
“Stahl, Stahl, what is the matter?” I said, and
began to cry.
</p>

<p>
Stahl seemed not to hear me. He continued
to walk up and down muttering to himself: “I
can wait, I can wait. Just a little longer—a little
longer—”
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky groaned. “Tell him to keep still,” he
said, his gaze indicating Stahl.
</p>

<p>
I seized Stahl by the arm. “You must keep
quiet,” I said. “Keep quiet at once.”
</p>

<p>
He turned to me a vacuous, bewildered face.
I grasped his arm convulsively, clutching it with
all my strength: “Keep still!”
</p>

<p>
Stahl sat down. “Right,” he said. “All
right.”
</p>

<p>
He searched his pocket and drew out a small
leather case.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky moved and moaned. “I am thirsty,”
he said. “Give me something to drink.”
</p>

<p>
I hurried to the bedside, and taking up a glass
of sweetened water, I raised him on his pillow
and held the glass to his lips. He drank eagerly.
Then—horror!... horror! Even as he drank I
perceived a spot of pale red color, wetting the
gauze round his neck, oozing through it and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
spreading in an ever-widening stain. What—what
could it be? It was the water he was drinking;
he was not swallowing it ... it was trickling
out through the wound in his neck. All the gauze
was already wet—now the pillow as well.
</p>

<p>
“Stahl, Stahl!” I shrieked. “Look, look at
this!”
</p>

<p>
Stahl, who seemed to have suddenly regained
his senses, came quickly to the bedside. I had laid
Bozevsky back on the pillow and he was looking
at us with wide-open eyes.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Stahl, contemplating him thoughtfully.
“Yes.” Suddenly he turned to me.
“Come here, come here. Why should I let you
suffer?”
</p>

<p>
Then I saw that he had in his hand a small glass
instrument—a morphia syringe. He seized my
wrist as in a vice and with the other hand pushed
back the loose sleeve of my gown.
</p>

<p>
“What are you going to do?” I gasped.
</p>

<p>
“Why, why should you suffer?” cried Stahl,
holding me tightly by the arm.
</p>

<p>
“Are you killing me?” I cried.
</p>

<p>
“No, no. I shall not kill you. You will see.”
</p>

<p>
I let him take my arm and he pricked it with
the needle of the syringe, afterwards pressing and
rubbing the punctured spot with his finger.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
“Now you will see, now you will see,” he repeated
over and over again with a vague stupefied
smile. “Sit down there,” and he impelled me towards
an armchair.
</p>

<p>
Bozevsky in his wet bandages on his wet pillow
was watching us. I wanted to go to his assistance,
to speak to him—but already a vague torpor was
stealing over me, a feeling of gentle langour
weighed upon my limbs. My tense and quivering
nerves gradually relaxed. I felt as if I were submerged
in a vague fluid serenity. Every anxious
thought dissolved in a bland and blissful somnolence....
I could see Bozevsky move restlessly
and again begin to turn his head from side to side.
Sunk in the divine lassitude that held me, I
watched his movements, glad that the sight of them
gave me no pain.
</p>

<p>
I saw that Stahl had stretched himself on the
couch and lay there with a vacant ecstatic smile
on his lips.
</p>

<p>
All at once Bozevsky uttered a cry. I heard
him, but I felt no inclination to answer. He
struggled into a sitting position and looked at us
both with wide, horrified eyes. He called us again
and again. Then he began to weep. I could hear
his weeping, but the beatific lethargy which engulfed
me held me motionless. Perhaps I was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
even smiling, so free and so remote did I feel from
all distress and suffering.
</p>

<p>
And now I saw Bozevsky with teeth clenched
and hands curved like talons, madly clutching and
tearing away the bandages from his neck.
</p>

<p>
He dragged and tore the gauze with quick
frenzied movements, while from his lips came a
succession of whimpering cries as of a dog imprisoned
behind a door.
</p>

<p>
I smiled, I know I smiled, as I gazed at him
from my armchair.
</p>

<p>
Stahl's eyes were shut; he was fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
Even when the wasted neck was stripped bare,
those quick, frenzied movements still continued.
What my eyes then saw I can never tell....
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Thus died Alexis Bozevsky, the handsomest
officer in the Imperial Guard.

<h2>
XIX
</h2>

<p>
After that all is dark. A blood-red abyss
seems to open in my memory wherein everything
is submerged—even my reason.
</p>

<p>
My reason! I have felt it totter and fall, like
something detached and apart from myself; and
I know that it has sunk into the grave that covers
Alexis Bozevsky.
</p>

<p>
Vaguely, from my distant childhood, a memory
rises up and confronts me.
</p>

<p>
I am in a school. I know not where. It is
sunset, and I am at play, happy and alone, in the
midst of a lawn; the daisies in the grass are
already closed and rose-tipped, blushing in their
sleep. Some one calls my name, and raising my
eyes I see the small eager face of my playmate
Tatiana peering out of an oval window in an old
turret, where none of us are ever allowed to
go. “Mura! Mura! Come quickly,” she cries.
“The turret is full of swallows!”
</p>

<p>
“Full of swallows!” I can still recall the
ecstasy of joy with which those three words filled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
me. I ran to the entrance of the old tower and
helter-skeltered up the dark and narrow staircase;
then, pushing aside a mildewed door, I found
myself with Tatiana in a gloomy loft, and yes, yes!
it was full of swallows!
</p>

<p>
They flew hither and thither, darting over our
heads, brushing our faces, making us shriek with
delight. We managed to catch any number of
them. Many were even lying on the ground.
Tatiana filled her apron with the fluttering creatures,
while I held some in my handkerchief and
some in my hands. Then we ran downstairs into
the dining-hall: “Look, look! we have caught a
lot of swallows!” I can still see the girls crowding
round us, and the face of the mistress bending
forward with an incredulous smile; I see her
shrink back, horrified and pale, with a cry of disgust:
“Mercy upon us! They are all bats!”
</p>

<p>
Even now the recollection of the shrieks we uttered
as we flung them from us makes my flesh
creep; even now I seem to feel the slippery smoothness
of those cold membranes gliding through my
fingers and near my cheeks....
</p>

<p>
To what end does this childish recollection enter
into the dark tragedy of my life? This—that
when I mount into the closed turret of my mind
in quest of winged thoughts and soaring fancies,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
alas! there glide through my brain only the
monstrous spirits of madness, the black bats of
hypochandria....
</p>

<p>
I remember little or nothing of those somber
days in Yalta. I can vaguely recollect Stahl telling
me over and over again in answer to my delirious
cries for Bozevsky: “He is dead! He is
dead! He is dead!” And as I could not and
would not believe him, he took me in a closed carriage
through many streets; then into a low building
and through echoing stone passages into a
large bare room—a dissecting room!
</p>

<p>
The horror of it seals my lips.
</p>

<p>
Still more vaguely do I recollect the death of
Stahl himself. I know that one evening he shot
himself through the heart, and was carried to the
hospital. I know that he sent me the following
words traced in tremulous handwriting on a torn
piece of paper: “Mura! I have only half an hour
to live. Come to me, I implore you. Come!”
</p>

<p>
I did not go to him. The terrible lessons he
had taught me were bearing fruit; all I did when
brought face to face with some new calamity was
to take injection after injection of morphia; and
thus I sank down again into the twilight world of
unreality in which, during that entire period, I
moved like one in a dream.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
I seemed to be living under water, in a perpetual
dimness—a fluid, undulating dusk.
</p>

<p>
No sooner did I find myself rising to the surface
of consciousness, and the noisy harshness of life
confronted me again, than my trembling hands
sought the case that hid the little glass viper of
oblivion—the hypodermic syringe of Pravaz.
</p>

<p>
Over the tremulous flame of a candle I heated
the phial of whitish powder and watched it
gradually dissolve into a clear crystalline liquid
that the hollow needle thirstily drank up: then
I bared my arm and thrust the steel point aslant
into my flesh. Soothing and benumbing the morphia
coursed through my veins; and I sank once
more into the well-known beatific lethargy, the undulating
dusk of unreality and sleep....
</p>

<p>
But one day a call thrilled through the enveloping
cloud and reached my heart: it was the call of
motherhood. Tioka! Tania! Where were my
children? Why, why were my arms empty when
these two helpless and beloved creatures were
mine?
</p>

<p>
Horrified at myself and at the dream-like apathy
in which I had strayed so long, I tore myself from
the degrading captivity of narcotics and with
trembling steps tottered towards the threshold of
life once more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
With dazed eyes I beheld the altered world
around me.
</p>

<p>
How everything had changed! I was no longer
the Countess Tarnowska, flattered, envied and
beloved. The women who had formerly been my
friends turned their eyes away from me, while on
the other hand men stared at me boldly in a way
they had never dared to look at me before.
Vassili—the frivolous, light-hearted Vassili—shut
his door upon me, and secluded himself in grim
and formidable silence as in the walls of a fortress.
Vainly did I beat upon it with weak hands, vainly
did I pray for pity. Inexorable and inaccessible
he remained, locked in his scorn and his resentment.
Nor ever have the gates of his home or of
his heart opened to me again.
</p>

<p>
I took refuge with my children at Otrada.
</p>

<p>
My parents received us in sorrow and humiliation.
Themselves too broken in spirit to offer
me any consolation, they moved silently through
the stately mansion, blushing for me before the
servants, hiding me from the eyes of their
friends.
</p>

<p>
Even my children hung their heads and crept
about on tiptoe, mute and abashed without knowing
why.
</p>

<p>
One day Tania, my little Tania, was snatched
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
from my arms. Vassili took her from me, nor did
I ever see her again.
</p>

<p>
I had gone out, I remember, sad and alone, into
the wintry park. By my side trotted Bear, my
father's faithful setter, who every now and then
thrust his moist and affectionate nose into my
hand. In my thoughts I was trying to face what
the future might have in store for me.
</p>

<p>
“When my little Tioka grows up,” I said to
myself, “I know, alas! that I shall lose him. He
will want to live with his father: he will look forward
to entering upon life under happy and propitious
auspices. Yes, Tioka will leave me, I know.
But my little girl will stay with me. Tania will
be my very own. She will grow up, fair and
gentle, by my side; I shall forget my sorrows in
her clinging love; I shall live my life over again
in hers. I shall be renewed, in strength and
purity, in my daughter's stainless youth.”
</p>

<p>
As I thus reflected I saw my mother running to
meet me, her gray head bare in the icy wind; she
was weeping bitterly. Tania was gone! Vassili
had taken her away!
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding all my tears and prayers it was
never vouchsafed to me to see my little girl again.
</p>

<p>
But when the day came in which they sought
to tear my son from me as well, I fought like a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
maddened creature, vowing that no human power
should take him from me while I lived. I fled with
him from Otrada—I fled I knew not and cared
not whither, clasping in my arms my tender fair-haired
prey, watching over him in terror, guarding
him with fervent prayers. I fled, hunted onward
by the restlessness that was in my own blood,
pursued by the bats of madness in my brain.
</p>

<p>
Thus began my aimless wanderings that were
to lead me so far astray.
</p>

<p>
Alone with little Tioka and the humble Elise
Perrier, I took to the highways of the world.
</p>

<p>
How helpless and terrified we were, all three of
us! It was like living in a melancholy fairy tale;
it was like the story of the babes lost in the wood.
Sometimes, in the midst of a street in some great
unknown city, little Tioka would stop and say:
“Mother, let us find some one who knows us, and
ask them where we are to go and what we are to
do.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no! Nobody must know us, Tioka.”
</p>

<p>
Then Tioka would begin to cry. “I feel as if
we were lost, as if we were lost!...” And I
knew not how to comfort him.
</p>

<p>
One day—we were at Moscow, I remember—there
appeared to me for the first time that lean
and threatening wolf which is called—<i>Poverty</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Poverty! I had never seen it at close range before.
I almost thought it did not really exist. I
knew, to be sure, that there were people in the
world who were in need of money; but those were
the people whom we gave charity to; that was all.
</p>

<p>
Poverty? What had poverty to do with us?
</p>

<p>
During all my life I had never given a thought
to money.

<p>
“Elise, I cannot bear to see myself in this ugly
black dress any longer. Write to Schanz and tell
him to send me some new gowns. I want a dark
green tailor-made costume, and a pearl-gray
voile.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my lady. But, begging your ladyship's
pardon, Schanz says that he would like to be paid.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, let us pay him then.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my lady. But, begging your ladyship's
pardon, his bill is twenty-five thousand rubles.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, let him have them.”
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry, my lady, but we have not got
twenty-five thousand rubles.”
</p>

<p>
It was true. We had not got twenty-five thousand
rubles.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, Tioka wants to be amused. He would
like a toy railway.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my lady.”
</p>

<p>
“Mind,” cried Tioka, “it must be like the one
we saw yesterday, with all those stations and
canals, and a Brooklyn bridge.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, Master Tioka.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
“Well, Elise, what are you waiting for?”
</p>

<p>
“Begging your ladyship's pardon, it costs eighty
rubles.”
</p>

<p>
“Well?”
</p>

<p>
“We have not got them.”
</p>

<p>
True enough; we had not got eighty rubles.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, I have no more perfumes. Go and get
me a bottle of Coty's Origant.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, my lady. But—”
</p>

<p>
“But what?”
</p>

<p>
“It costs twelve rubles.”
</p>

<p>
“Well?”
</p>

<p>
“We have not got them.”
</p>

<p>
And indeed we had not got twelve rubles.
</p>

<p>
I thought it very sad not to have twenty-five
thousand rubles, nor even twelve rubles, when I
required them.
</p>

<p>
I resolved to telegraph to my mother.
</p>

<p>
Feeling sad and perplexed, I went to the telegraph
office and sat down at a table to write my
message:
</p>

<p>
“Mother, dear, we are unhappy and forlorn;
Tioka and I want to come home and stay with you
always. Please send us at once—”
</p>

<p>
I was meditating on what sum to mention, when
I felt the touch of a hand upon my shoulder.
Startled, I turned, and raised my eyes. Before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
me stood a man—dark, rather tall, with a brown
mustache and pendulous cheeks. Surely I knew
him! Where had I seen that face before? Suddenly
there flashed into my mind the recollection
of a crowded, brilliantly lighted restaurant. I
saw Vassili, amid much laughter, counting the
dark-eyed tziganes to see if one of them were missing—<i>Prilukoff!</i>
“The Scorpion!” It was he
who stood before me.
</p>

<p>
“Countess Tarnowska! Who would have
dreamt of finding you here!” he exclaimed.
“What are you doing in Moscow?”
</p>

<p>
“I—I do not know,” I stammered. I had in
fact not infrequently asked myself what I was doing
in Moscow.
</p>

<p>
“I have heard of all your misfortunes,” he said,
lowering his voice, and gazing at me sympathetically.
“I have read the papers and heard all the
fuss. Come now, come,” he added, “you must
not weep. Let us go and have tea at the Métropole;
there we can talk together.” And he took
me familiarly by the arm.
</p>

<p>
I drew back. “I wanted to telegraph—,” I
began.
</p>

<p>
“Telegraph? To whom?” inquired Prilukoff
with an authoritative air.
</p>

<p>
“To my mother.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
“Why? What do you want to telegraph to her
for?”
</p>

<p>
I flushed. “I—I have no money—” I stammered.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I have,” said Prilukoff, and he drew me
out of the office.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the steps he stopped and looked
me in the face. “What a fortunate meeting!”
he said. “Our lucky star must have brought it
about.” With these words his brown eyes looked
straight into mine. “Our lucky star!” he repeated.
</p>

<p>
Merciful heaven, why did not a whisper, not a
breath of warning come to me then? Why did
no tremor in my soul admonish me, no heavenly
inspiration hold me back? Nothing, nothing
checked the smile upon my lips, nor the words in
which I gaily answered him:
</p>

<p>
“Our lucky star! So be it.” And I took his
arm.
</p>

<p>
The die of my destiny was cast. I went out on
my way to destruction and ruin.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
There were many people and much music in the
Métropole when we entered.
</p>

<p>
It is strange to think how all the memorable
and significant hours of my life are associated in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
my mind with the entrancing rhythm of dance-music,
with the lilting tunes of waltz, mazurka and
polonaise.
</p>

<p>
All the tragedies, all the extravagances that convulsed
my existence bloomed up like tragic modern
flowers in the hothouse of some fashionable restaurant,
under the feverish breath of a tzigane
orchestra.
</p>

<p>
So great became the power of this obsession
over me, that no sooner did I enter a restaurant
where there were people, and lights, and the music
of stringed instruments, than I straightway felt
as if I had lost my senses. Under the influence
of such an atmosphere all my thoughts assumed
disordered and extravagant forms. The tones
of the violins excited and electrified me; as the
bows swept the quivering strings I also quivered
and vibrated, shaken with indescribable perturbation.
The waves of sound seemed to envelop
me in a turbid vortex of sentiment and sensibility.
</p>

<p>
Ah, if there had been more silence in my life,
more shade, more seclusion! It is not within the
safe walls of the home, not at one's own peaceful
and inviolate hearth that perversity stirs to
life and catastrophe is born.
</p>

<p>
Oh! Tania, my only daughter, if the wishes of
your sorrowful mother could but reach you and her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
prayers for you be granted, they would encompass
with shade and silence your young and virginal
heart.
</p>

<p>
And I—ah, if I could but go back to the white
vacant land of childhood, I would kneel down and
entreat from heaven naught else but shade and
silence in my life....
</p>

<p>
But in the Café Métropole the blazing lights
were lit, the orchestra was swinging its unhallowed
censer of waltz-music through the perfumed air
and the Scorpion was sitting before me drinking
his tea and laughing.
</p>

<p>
“Do you remember how much afraid you were
of me at the Strelna, when I jumped from the divan
and touched your shoulder? And afterwards—when
you found me asleep at the bottom of the
sleigh?”
</p>

<p>
Yes, I remembered.
</p>

<p>
“And now you are no longer afraid of me?”
</p>

<p>
No. Now I was no longer afraid of him.
</p>

<p>
Fate, the Fury, standing behind me, must have
laughed as with her nebulous hand she covered my
smiling eyes.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXI
</h2>

<p>
What charmed and delighted me most in the
Scorpion was a pet phrase of his that he was constantly
using: “<i>Leave that to me!</i>”
</p>

<p>
He said it every minute, a hundred times a day.
Occasionally there might be a slight variation; he
might say, “Don't trouble your head about that”;
or “Never mind, I'll see to it.” But as a rule it
was the brief enchanting sentence: “Leave that
to me.”
</p>

<p>
I cannot possibly describe the sense of utter relief
and comfort with which those few words inspired
me. I felt unburdened, as it were, exonerated,
set free from every responsibility, from
every anxiety, almost from every thought. It was
as if Prilukoff had said of my very soul, “Leave it
to me,” so complete was my sense of tranquil relinquishment.
</p>

<p>
In truth I had never given much thought to the
practical side of life. No sense of responsibility
had ever weighed upon my narrow shoulders;
there had always been so many people around me
to give me advice, to direct me, to think and to
act on my behalf!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
When I had suddenly found myself alone in the
world with Tioka and Elise I had felt more frightened
and more helpless than they. But now, here
once more was some one ready to direct me, ready
to think and act and decide for me. Occasionally,
realizing my position, I exclaimed anxiously:
“Dear me, what shall I do about money?”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff would answer briefly: “Leave that
to me.”
</p>

<p>
“But how shall I pay my bills?”
</p>

<p>
“Leave your bills to me.”
</p>

<p>
“And how shall I prevent Vassili from robbing
me of Tioka!”
</p>

<p>
“Don't bother about Tioka. Leave him to me.”
</p>

<p>
“And, oh dear! I wish I could be divorced from
Vassili.”
</p>

<p>
“You shall be divorced; I shall see to it.”
</p>

<p>
“But what will my mother say?”
</p>

<p>
“Leave your mother to me.”
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be nothing in the world that
could not be left to the omniscient and all-sufficing
care of Donat Prilukoff. I was deeply moved and
grateful.
</p>

<p>
“How shall I ever be able to thank you?”
</p>

<p>
“Leave the thanking to me,” said Prilukoff.
</p>

<p>
For a long time, indeed, he seemed neither to
desire nor expect any gratitude. He looked after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
my interests, my divorce, my parents, my son, my
maid, my debts, and my health. But he asked for
no thanks; all he required was that I should be
docile and content.
</p>

<p>
It was a period of respite. Soon I forgot that
I had ever thought of him as a Scorpion or an
octopus. Indeed, he was to my eyes a strange and
delightful mixture of knight errant, of guardian
saint, of commissionaire and hero.
</p>

<p>
I did not feel then that every favor, every
counsel I asked of him, was but another link in
the subtle chain that bound me to him.
</p>

<p>
Soon I was unable to do anything without asking
for his opinion and his assistance. Tioka,
Elise and I grew accustomed to see him arrive with
his masterful air and brisk greeting every afternoon;
then every morning; then every evening as
well. We never went out without him; no letter
was received or written without its being given to
him to read.
</p>

<p>
If Tioka broke a toy, if Elise was overcharged
in an account, if I received an anonymous letter,
it was immediately referred to Prilukoff. He put
everything into his pocket, saying: “Leave that
to me.”
</p>

<p>
And, true to his word, he mended the toys, he
adjusted the accounts, he discovered and punished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
my anonymous slanderers. He was astute, deliberate
and intelligent.
</p>

<p>
I felt convinced that he was also kind and generous
and good.
</p>

<p>
Who can say that in those days he was not so?
The dreadful Prilukoff, assassin and blackmailer,
who turned against me, livid with wrath, in the
court-room at Venice, was he—could he be?—the
same Prilukoff who, in those far-off days, mended
little Tioka's playthings? Who was so anxious if
he saw me looking pale? Of whom Elise, clasping
her work-worn hands, used to say: “When he appears
he seems to me like Lohengrin!”
</p>

<p>
Lohengrin! How bitterly I smile, remembering
all that ensued. And yet—I cannot believe it. I
cannot understand it. Which of those two beings—the
maleficent demon or the chivalrous knight—was
the real Prilukoff?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, when these sinister years of prison
and sorrow are past that cancel in their flight so
many things, and shed light upon so many others,
some day he may cross my path again. Shall I
then not discern in his faded, grief-stricken face
the strong and compassionate Lohengrin of long
ago?...
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile I drifted on, submissive to my fate.
</p>

<p>
Only two things perturbed me. One was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
fear lest Tioka should be taken from me—an anguish
that was with me day and night. The other
was a torturing secret, which I confided to no one.
It was—how shall I say it?—my terror of closed
doors!
</p>

<p>
Every time I found myself alone in front of a
closed door, I did not dare to open it. I had the
fixed, frightful idea that behind the door I should
see—Bozevsky! I had the irremovable conviction
that he was standing, motionless and expectant,
behind every door that confronted me. All the
doors of our apartment had to be kept wide open.
If it ever happened that I found myself alone in
a room of which the door was closed, instead of
opening it I rang the bell, I called, I cried for help;
and if it chanced that every one was out, or no one
heard me, I stood riveted to the spot, rigid with
fear, staring at the terrifying mystery of that
closed door before me. Perchance, with a great
effort of will, holding my breath while the beads
of cold perspiration started on my brow, I ventured
to put out my hand towards the handle—but
in an instant I found myself pushing the door to
again, leaning desperately with all my strength
against the frail barrier which concealed—oh, I
knew it did!—Bozevsky, standing upright and
terrible, with the yellow gauze round his neck.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
This notion, horrible as it was in the daytime,
became an unbearable fear after nightfall. Tioka
went upstairs to bed, accompanied by Elise, at
about eight o'clock. Twice it happened that, when
they were both asleep, a draught caught the open
door of the drawing-room in which I was sitting,
and shut it. With chattering teeth, and shivers
running over me like chilly water, I remained
there, motionless, through all the hours of the
night, knowing that Bozevsky was there, separated
from me only by that slender wooden partition.
</p>

<p>
In the morning Elise found me lying on the floor
in a faint.
</p>

<p>
One day Elise was summoned to Neuchâtel.
Her father was at the point of death, and wished
to give his last embrace and blessing to his only
daughter. It was five o'clock in the afternoon
when the telegram for Elise arrived; at eight
o'clock, distracted and weeping, she was in the
train.
</p>

<p>
Tioka and I, who had accompanied her to the
station, returned homeward feeling sad and lonely.
We felt doubly lonely that day, as Donat Prilukoff
had been obliged to leave Moscow on account of
a lawsuit, and was not to return until the following
evening.
</p>

<p>
We had, it is true, another serving-woman, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
cook; but she left us every evening to go and sleep
at her own home.
</p>

<p>
We entered our dark and silent apartment nervously.
I hastily turned on all the lights and then
carried Tioka, who was cross and already half
asleep, up the inner staircase leading to our bedrooms.
</p>

<p>
I undressed him and put him to bed, tucking
him up warmly and comfortably.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, dear,” he sighed, rubbing his eyes; “do
you think the wolves will come and eat me if I
don't say my prayers to-night?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, dearest. I will say them for you. Go
to sleep.”
</p>

<p>
I kissed him and turned out the light; then I
went downstairs to get a book from the library,
intending to return to my room at once. I felt
nervous and restless. I was afraid I should not
be able to sleep.
</p>

<p>
How did it happen? Perhaps it was an instant's
forgetfulness that caused me to draw the
door of the library after me. It closed with a
heavy thud. The long, dark-red curtain turned on
its rod and fell in front of the doorway.
</p>

<p>
I was imprisoned!
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXII
</h2>

<p>
I should never dare to leave that room.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I thought that Tioka might call me.
But between him and me, standing outside on the
threshold of that draped door, was there not the
man whom I had seen die in Yalta? Horrifying
memory! For a long time I did not venture to
stir. I turned my head and looked behind me,
then fixed my eyes afresh on the red curtain. Suddenly
I thought I heard a cry.
</p>

<p>
Yes; it was Tioka calling me, Tioka all alone
upstairs, who was frightened too, frightened even
as I was. With shivers swathing me from head
to foot as with an icy sheet, I listened to those
cries which every moment grew shriller and wilder.
Then, in answer to him, I screamed too.
</p>

<p>
Oh, those shrieks ringing through the empty
house—shrieks which only that silent ghost behind
the door could hear!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly another thrill ran through me; the
electric bell had sounded. Some one was ringing
at our door; some one was coming to save us.
Tioka still screamed, and the bell continued to ring.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
I could also hear blows on the door and then a
voice—Prilukoff's voice—calling: “It is I.
Open the door!”
</p>

<p>
With a sob of mingled terror and joy I thrust
back the curtain and flung open the dreaded door.
Stumbling blindly through the passage I reached
the hall door and drew back the latch. Prilukoff
stood on the threshold; he was pale as death.
</p>

<p>
“What has happened?” he cried. “What is
the matter?” And he gripped my arm.
</p>

<p>
I was sobbing with joy and relief. “Tioka,
Tioka!” I called out. “Don't cry any more.
Donat has come! We are here, we are near you!”
</p>

<p>
Tioka's cries ceased at once.
</p>

<p>
But Prilukoff still held me fast. “What has
happened!” he asked, clenching his teeth.
</p>

<p>
“I was afraid, I was afraid—” I gasped.
</p>

<p>
“Of whom?”
</p>

<p>
A fresh outburst of tears shook me. “Of the
dead,” I sobbed.
</p>

<p>
“Leave the dead to me,” said Prilukoff.
</p>

<p>
He entered and shut the door.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
Thus, unconscious and unwilling, I descended yet
another step down the ladder of infamy.
</p>

<p>
Shrinking and reluctant I trailed my white garments
into defilement, sinking with every step
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
deeper into the mire which was soon to engulf me;
the mire which was to reach my proud heart, my
pearl-encircled throat, my exalted brow on which
nobility had set its seal in vain.
</p>

<p>
It was about that time, I remember, that Delphinus,
a renowned fortune-teller, came to Moscow.
One morning, having nothing else to do, I went
with the smiling, skeptical Elise to consult him in
his luxurious apartments.
</p>

<p>
He took both my hands and gazed for a long
time at a crystal ball which was before him. Then
he said: “Woman, your life is a tragedy.”
</p>

<p>
I smiled, incredulous yet disturbed. “Pray say
rather a comedy, if you can.”
</p>

<p>
He shook his head. “A tragedy,” he repeated
gloomily. Then he uttered several commonplaces
which might apply to any other woman as well
as to me. Finally, with knitted brows, he looked
still more closely into the crystal. “Two men,”
he said, speaking slowly, “have yet to enter into
your life. One will bring salvation, the other ruin.
Choose the one, and you will attain happiness;
choose the other and you will perish.”
</p>

<p>
He paused. “You will choose the other,” he
said, and released my hand.
</p>

<p>
I got up, smiling. “Oh, no, indeed! Now that
I have been forewarned—”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
“You will choose the other,” he repeated oracularly.
“It is your destiny.”
</p>

<p>
Although I am not really superstitious, this
curt, obscure prediction impressed me strangely.
</p>

<p>
“I shall beware of whom I meet,” I said to myself;
and indeed, every time a man spoke to me,
even casually, I wondered: could this be the One?—or
the Other?
</p>

<p>
But days and months passed, and I made no
new acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff kept me jealously secluded, and little
Tioka absorbed my every hour. Apart from these
two I saw no one at all.
</p>

<p>
It was by mere chance that one day I met a
former acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
I had taken Tioka for a walk in the park when
we saw a gentleman and a child sitting on a
bench in the shade. They were both dressed in
deep mourning, and they looked sad and disconsolate.
The little boy was leaning his fair head
on his father's arm, watching him as, with an air
of melancholy abstraction, he traced hieroglyphics
in the gravel with his stick. On hearing us approach
the man in mourning raised his head and
looked at us.
</p>

<p>
I recognized him at once. It was Count Paul
Kamarowsky, the husband of one of my dearest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
friends, who lived at Dresden, and whom I had not
seen for nearly two years.
</p>

<p>
He recognized me, too, and started to his
feet with eager face, while the little boy looked
at us diffidently, still holding to his father's
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
“Countess Tarnowska!” he exclaimed, holding
out both his hands.
</p>

<p>
I laid my hand in his; as he clasped it between
his black-gloved fingers a slight shiver ran through
me. I turned to the pale little child beside him
who was still glancing up at me timidly. “Is this
Grania?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes. It is Grania,” said Count Kamarowsky.
Then he perceived my questioning glance at his
mourning. “Poor Emilia—” he began, but his
voice broke.
</p>

<p>
“Poor Emilia?” Was it possible that my little
school friend of long ago, the fair-haired, laughter-loving
Lily should now be “poor Emilia,” to
be spoken of in solemn, mournful tones? I could
hardly believe it. I seemed to see her still, bending
over her 'cello with her fair curls tumbling
over her face as she played her favorite Popper
tarantelle.... I could see her laughing with mischievous
eyes agleam behind her flaxen locks, like
dark stars seen through a golden cloud. And
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
here, clad in mourning for her, her husband and
child stood before me.
</p>

<p>
Great tenderness and pity filled my heart.
</p>

<p>
Tioka had gone close to Grania, and the two
children were looking at each other with that expression
of simple gravity which is so far removed
from the conventional smile with which grown-up
people greet each other for the first time. Their
gaze was serious, thoughtful and interrogative.
</p>

<p>
“Do you like pelicans?” Tioka inquired suddenly.
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Grania.
</p>

<p>
“Neither do I,” said Tioka; and there was a
long silence.
</p>

<p>
“Do you like ducks?” asked Tioka.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” replied Grania.
</p>

<p>
“So do I,” said Tioka; and their friendship was
sealed.
</p>

<p>
Count Kamarowsky and I were less prompt in
discovering a community of tastes such as that
which so quickly linked our two children together.
This grave silent man in his widower's garb was
almost a stranger to me. As we parted he asked
permission to call. But on the following day a
telegram from my father summoned me to Otrada.
My mother was ill and desired my presence.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXIII
</h2>

<p>
It was a hurried departure and an anxious
journey. We arrived late in the evening at my
father's house. He came to meet us at the gate,
tall and solemn, his white hair stirred by the wind.
He kissed me without speaking and laid his hand
on Tioka's head.
</p>

<p>
“Mother—?” I scarcely dared to inquire.
</p>

<p>
“Better. She is better. She has improved
greatly since she knew you were coming.”
</p>

<p>
Tioka had hurriedly kissed his grandfather's
hand, and now was hastening up the great staircase
to see his grandmother, to whom he was passionately
attached. Soon his rippling laughter
and his nimble footsteps could be heard all over
the house, and my mother said that the happiness
of it had well-nigh cured her.
</p>

<p>
It was scarcely daybreak next morning when
Tioka came to call me to go down with him into
the garden.
</p>

<p>
The great garden at Otrada—the garden of my
girlhood—glowed in all its summer splendor, and
Tioka ran before me with cries of joy at everything
he saw.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
“Look at the water! Look at the little bridge!
Did you play here when you were little? Were
you ever really little?” He looked at me doubtfully.
“I mean really quite little—like Tania.”
</p>

<p>
The mention of his sister's name was like a blow
to my heart. But Tioka was already flying across
the lawn.
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” he cried. “There's the swing! I had
forgotten there was a swing! Hurrah!”
</p>

<p>
“Hush, hush, dearest,” I warned; “don't disturb
grandmama who is ill.”
</p>

<p>
He swung backwards and forwards, careless
and handsome, shaking his blond hair in the wind.
</p>

<p>
“Grandmama cannot hear me; she is fast
asleep still. And besides she is not ill any more
now that we are here; otherwise grandpapa would
not have gone to Kieff to-day.” Tioka jumped
down from the swing and raised his face to me
with adorable seriousness. “Tell me, mother,
when one is ill with nervousness doesn't that
mean that you want something you haven't got?
Then if you get it you are well again, aren't you?
Grandmama wanted us. We came. And now she
is cured.” After a pause he went on: “I think
I am ill with nervousness too. I am nervous for a
bowl of goldfish; and for a hunting dog like that
one,” he added, indicating a large setter lying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
stretched in the sun with his muzzle on his
paws.
</p>

<p>
“Why, that is Bear!” I cried, “our old Bear.”
I bent down to caress him. “Dear Bear, good
Bear! Don't you recognize me?”
</p>

<p>
Bear raised his languid, blood-shot eyes, but did
not stir.
</p>

<p>
“How sad he looks,” I said, touching his muzzle
to see whether his nose was hot. “Perhaps he is
ill.”
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps he is nervous, too,” said Tioka.
“Very likely he is nervous because he wants a
bone.” And the child broke into a peal of shrill,
merry laughter.
</p>

<p>
In an instant the great dog had turned and
leaped upon him. Snarling and growling he tore
at his clothes, covering his shoulders and breast
with blood-stained foam.
</p>

<p>
Tioka fell shrieking to the ground. I flung myself
upon the frenzied animal, seizing him by the
collar, by the ears, and striving to drag him back;
but with hoarse growls and snappish barks the
dog kept biting and tearing the child's garments
as he lay prostrate and inert on the gravel. With
one hand I clutched the neck of the dog, while with
the other I picked up a stone and beat him on the
head with it until the blood ran.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
With a roar like that of a tiger, the animal
turned and sprang upon me.
</p>

<p>
I felt the sting of his fang as it bit into my arm,
and I struck his nose with the stone which was
already covered with blood. With a cry of pain
that had almost a human sound, the dog released
his hold, turned and went off.
</p>

<p>
I saw him trotting away along the path,
surly and dreadful, with his tail hanging down
and his wounded head showing red in the
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
I picked up the moaning, sobbing Tioka and ran
with him to the house.
</p>

<p>
“Don't cry! don't cry, my darling,” I implored
him, myself in tears. “Don't let poor grandmama
hear you! It will kill her.” And Tioka
tried his best to cry more softly. We crossed the
courtyard to the servants' entrance, and I ran into
the kitchen where the servants came thronging
round us in alarm.
</p>

<p>
“The dog—,” I panted, “the dog has bitten us—do
you think it will give us hydrophobia?”
With a groan I dropped little Tioka into a chair;
he was a pitiable sight in his torn and bloodstained
garments.
</p>

<p>
The women and the two moujiks wrung their
hands. “Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! What shall we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
do? With the master at Kieff and the Countess
ill in bed!”
</p>

<p>
The cook had filled a basin with boiling water
and was laving Tioka's wounds, while he screamed
with the redoubled pain.
</p>

<p>
I knew it was necessary to do something instantly.
But what? I remembered having read
in the life of the three Brontë sisters that one of
those heroic girls had been bitten by a mad dog,
and that she herself, without disturbing her sister,
who was ill with consumption, had heated an iron
red-hot and had cauterized her own wounds.
</p>

<p>
“Put an iron in the fire!” I said, pointing with
trembling hand to the poker.
</p>

<p>
The dismayed women did so, and I bared my
arm and little Tioka's lacerated shoulder.
</p>

<p>
But when I had the terrible instrument with
its glowing point in my hand, my courage failed.
Tioka was shrieking with terror like a poor little
maddened creature, and the women were on their
knees, weeping and praying.
</p>

<p>
Alas, I am not a heroine; I threw away the red-hot
iron; we bound up the wounds—which, after
they had been washed, looked insignificant and
harmless enough—and determined to go to Kieff
at once and consult a doctor. We went upstairs on
tip-toe to my mother's room. She was still sleeping
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
quietly, with her small, pinched face sunk in
the pillow.
</p>

<p>
We did not venture to wake her and tell her our
terrifying story. We left orders with the servants
that they were to say my father had summoned us
to meet him in Kieff; and we started.
</p>

<p>
All the way I watched Tioka with the deepest
anxiety. I also probed my own feelings intently,
wondering whether I felt any desire to bark. I
cannot say that I did. Also, during the entire
journey, I kept on showing Tioka glasses of water,
but he did not seem to feel any the worse for them;
nor did I. This comforted us a little.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we reached Kieff I telegraphed to
Prilukoff:
</p>

<p>
“<i>Both of us bitten by mad dog. What shall we
do?</i>”
</p>

<p>
He replied: “<i>All right. Leave it to me.</i>”
</p>

<p>
And, indeed, he arrived immediately and took
us to Doctor Fritkof, who gave us injections of
antirabic serum for three weeks. It made us feel
very ill. Every minute I asked Tioka: “Do you
feel inclined to bite any one?”
</p>

<p>
He invariably replied in the affirmative, which
made me very miserable.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXIV
</h2>

<p>
Although Tioka and I both recovered, this
alarming incident had its consequences on my life.
It caused me to leave my old home, and from the
moment of that departure I never saw my dear
mother again.
</p>

<p>
With the passing of her mild and tender presence
all that still was pure and holy vanished out
of my life.
</p>

<p>
I was already on the brink of perdition. Freed
from the restraint of that gentle hand, whose light
touch even from afar had still controlled my heart,
I plunged forward to destruction.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The inheritance was divided, and my share was
dissipated I know not how. I returned to Moscow,
and found myself ever more and more in need
of money.
</p>

<p>
I lived luxuriously, I dressed gorgeously, and
traveled from one place to another—yet I had
nothing of my own except an income of four thousand
rubles a year, which were scarcely paid to me
before they were swallowed up in the gulf of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
debts. I asked Prilukoff for money, and he gave
it to me.
</p>

<p>
But there came a day when, on my asking him
for five thousand rubles, he turned upon me
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
“I have not got them,” he said. “At least,”
he added, “not unless I steal them.”
</p>

<p>
“How dreadful,” I exclaimed in terror. “How
can you say such a thing?” Then I laughed, feeling
sure that he had spoken in jest.
</p>

<p>
“Get them from Kamarowsky,” said Prilukoff,
curtly.
</p>

<p>
I started with indignation. From Kamarowsky!
Never, never, as long as I lived. I had
seen him frequently during the last few days;
he and his charming little son, Grania, still in their
deep mourning and with pale, sad faces, used to
come and see me, and talk to me with many tears
about their dear one who was gone. It would
have been horrible, it would have been indecorous,
to ask Kamarowsky for money.
</p>

<p>
“I did not say you were to ask him for it,” retorted
Prilukoff.
</p>

<p>
“What then?”
</p>

<p>
“Telephone and invite him to dine with you
to-morrow.”
</p>

<p>
“Well? And then?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
“Then we shall see.”
</p>

<p>
As he insisted I complied reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky accepted the invitation with touching
gratitude, and a large basket of roses preceded
his arrival.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff, who was still hanging about in my
boudoir, but declared that he would not stay to
dinner, sniffed the roses with a cynical smile:
</p>

<p>
“Flowers! Flowers! Nothing but flowers!
<i>Nous allons changer tout cela.</i>”
</p>

<p>
The door bell rang, announcing the arrival of
my visitor.
</p>

<p>
“What am I to do with him now he is here?”
I asked Prilukoff uneasily. “What shall I
say?”
</p>

<p>
“Do nothing and say nothing. And mind you
don't open any letter in his presence.”
</p>

<p>
“Any letter?” I asked, in bewilderment.
“What letter?”
</p>

<p>
“I tell you not to open any. That is enough.”
With this obscure injunction Prilukoff urged me
towards the drawing-room, and I went in to receive
my guest.
</p>

<p>
Count Kamarowsky, while inspiring me with the
deepest pity, frequently irritated and annoyed me.
His grief for his lost Emilia was doubtless deep
and sincere; but sometimes when I tried to console
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
him I seemed to read in his tear-filled eyes an emotion
that was not all sorrow, and in the clasp of
his hand I perceived a fervor that spoke of something
more than gratitude. I felt hurt for the
sake of my poor friend, Lily, so lately laid to her
rest; and I shrank from him with feelings akin to
anger and aversion.
</p>

<p>
Yet, when I saw him moving away, pale in his
deep mourning, leading his sad little child by the
hand, my heart was touched and I would call them
back to me and try to comfort them both. The
child clung to me with passionate affection, while
his father seemed loth ever to leave my side.
</p>

<p>
Conversation between us always soared in the
highest regions of ethereal and spiritual things;
our talk was all on abstract subjects, dwelling
especially on the immortality of the soul, the abode
of the departed, the probabilities of reunion in the
world beyond. The commonplace everyday prose
of life was so far removed from our intercourse
that I felt shy of having asked him to dinner. To
eat in the presence of so much sorrow seemed indecorous
and out of keeping. Nevertheless, as I
had invited him to dine I could not but seat myself
opposite him at the flower-decked, fruit-laden
table.
</p>

<p>
A man-servant, lent to me for the occasion by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Prilukoff, handed the zakusta and the vodka; and
soon in the mellow atmosphere of the little dining-room,
under the gentle luster of the pink-shaded
lamps, a rare smile blossomed timidly now and
then out of the gloom of our melancholy conversation.
</p>

<p>
We had scarcely finished taking our coffee when,
to my astonishment, Prilukoff was announced.
He entered with rapid step, holding a large sealed
envelope in his hand. For a moment he seemed
disconcerted at finding that I was not alone, and
looked as if he would hide the letter behind his
back. Then, with a slight shrug of the shoulders,
as if acquiescing in the unavoidable presence of a
stranger, he handed me the envelope with a deep
bow.
</p>

<p>
“What is it?” I asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff glanced somewhat uneasily at my
guest, then he bent forward and said in a low voice—yet
not so low that the other could not hear what
he said:
</p>

<p>
“This morning, Countess, you did me the honor
of confiding to me the fact that you needed ten
thousand rubles. I shall be most grateful and
honored if you will accept that sum from me.”
So saying, he placed the envelope in my hand.
Then with a brief salutation to Count Kamarowsky
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
and another profound bow to me, he
pleaded haste and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
A flush had mounted to the Count's temples.
</p>

<p>
“Who was that?” he asked in a harsh voice.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned Prilukoff's name, and Kamarowsky
with knitted eyebrows exclaimed: “You must
have very confidential relations with him, if he
permits himself to give you ten thousand rubles.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no—no,” I stammered. “He is—he is
only lending them to me. I shall pay them back,
of course—”
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky had risen from his chair. He
took both my hands and pressed them to his breast.
</p>

<p>
“How wrong of you! How wrong! Why did
you not ask me? Have you no confidence in me?
How can you accept assistance from a stranger
when I am here—I, who am so devoted to you?”
</p>

<p>
I know not why I burst into tears. A sense of
shame and degradation overcame me. In a moment
his arms were round me.
</p>

<p>
“Dearest, sweetest, do not cry. I know you
must feel humiliated at accepting money from that
man, who may afterwards make all kinds of claims
upon you. Return the money to him, I implore
you, and accept it from me.”
</p>

<p>
I could not answer for my tears.
</p>

<p>
“Promise me that you will give it back,” Kamarowsky
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
went on, clasping me closer to him. “If
you refuse me this favor I shall go away and you
shall never see me again. For the sake of our
Emilia—for the sake of little Grania—accept it
from me. And let me be your friend from now
on and forever.”
</p>

<p>
It took a long time to reconcile me to the sense
of my own debasement.
</p>

<p>
He wrote out a check to me for ten thousand
rubles and put it into my hands. He closed my
fingers forcibly over it, pressing them closely and
thanking me in a moved voice.
</p>

<p>
Then he went away, and I was left alone with
the check and Prilukoff's sealed envelope.
</p>

<p>
I had wanted five thousand rubles and here I
was with twenty thousand before me!
</p>

<p>
Poor, good Kamarowsky! And poor, dear,
kind Prilukoff!
</p>

<p>
“I do not see why I should really return this
to Prilukoff!” I said to myself.
</p>

<p>
I broke the seals and opened the envelope that
he had presented to me with so much solemnity.
Petrified with astonishment I gazed at its contents.
Then I laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
“On the whole, I think I <i>will</i> return it,” I said,
and laid the envelope aside.
</p>

<p>
It was full of old newspaper cuttings!

<h2>
XXV
</h2>

<p>
<i>Facilis descensus Averni.</i>
</p>

<p>
My downfall was rapid and irretrievable.
</p>

<p>
I soon became familiar with expedients and
intrigues, I trod the tortuous paths that lead down
into the valley of dishonor. For the outside
world I might still appear a person of distinction,
I might still call myself the Countess Tarnowska,
but I had ceased to be that simple, ordinary, peerless
being—an honest woman. I seemed to be
surrounded by that peculiar atmosphere which
envelops the adventuress as in an invisible mist—that
imperceptible emanation by which persons of
repute are instinctively repelled, and which draws
within its ambit the idler and adventurer, the
depredator and outcast of society.
</p>

<p>
I had accepted money to which I had no claim.
From this want of dignity to the want of rectitude
how brief is the step! Between indiscretion and
transgression how uncertain is the boundary!
And suddenly there comes a day when one awakes
to find oneself—a criminal!
</p>

<p>
Ah, then we stop short in horror. We look back
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
and see the abyss, the impassable gulf that henceforward
separates us from the distant, candid
summits of innocence. How has it been possible
for us to travel along that vertiginous road which
knows no return? What evil spirits have bandaged
our eyes, have placed for our feet bridges and
stepping stones so that almost without noticing it
we have crossed ravines and precipices which
never in this life we may traverse again? We can
but go forward and downward: we can turn back
no more.
</p>

<p>
Not at this period did I realize the irrevocable
character of the fate I had chosen. Rather did I
seem to perceive a new life opening out before me,
leading me back once more to rectitude and honor,
a return to that peaceful, conventional existence
so often scorned by those who lead it, so bitterly
regretted and desired by those who have forfeited
and forsaken it.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff still held me bound to him by the triple
bonds of gratitude, of affection and of complicity.
But Count Kamarowsky was swaying me towards
a brighter and securer future. My marriage with
Vassili, so long merely an empty and nominal tie,
was about to be dissolved by a decree from the
Holy Synod, and Kamarowsky implored me to
marry him. His sadness and the loneliness of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
little son moved me deeply; the thought of bringing
light and joy into their lives was unspeakably
sweet to me, while for my part I rejoiced to think
that by the side of a worthy and honorable man
I might take my place in the world once more, rehabilitated
and redeemed. With Prilukoff, as I
could see, downfall and ruin were imminent. He
had left Moscow for a few days; but he would return,
and alas! he would resume his dominion over
me. I knew that with him the ultimate plunge into
dishonor was inevitable.
</p>

<p>
And so with bitter tears of repentance, clasping
the two fair heads of Tioka and Grania to my
breast, I vowed to Heaven that I would be to them
both a tender and a faithful mother, worthy of the
lofty duty that by Divine grace was to be once
more assigned to me.
</p>

<p>
Count Kamarowsky's gratitude and joy were
boundless.
</p>

<p>
“You are giving back life to me,” he said, his
kind eyes shining with emotion. “I do not feel
worthy of so much happiness.”
</p>

<p>
“Don't, don't!” I said, turning away my face
and flushing deeply at the thought of my recent
unprincipled life. “It is I, I who am unworthy—”
</p>

<p>
But Kamarowsky interrupted me.
</p>

<p>
“Hush, Marie, hush. I know that you have suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
much and that you have been led astray.
But let the dead past bury the past. All I ask of
you is the pure white page of the future.”
</p>

<p>
“You are generous, you are kind,” I said, and
tears burned in my eyes. “But let me tell you,
let me tell you all—”
</p>

<p>
“Mura,” he said, calling me by the tender pet-name
of my childhood, “do not raise impassable
barriers between us. What I have no knowledge
of does not exist so far as I am concerned. The
unknown is but a shadow; and I am not afraid
of shadows. But if to that shadow you give a
living shape and a name, it will rise between you
and me, and I shall not be able to clasp you in my
arms until I have destroyed it. Speak if you
must. But, for our happiness, it were far better
for you to keep silence—and to forget.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, you are right! Let there be no more
sorrow, no more tragedies around me. Take me
away from Moscow, away from all who know me.
I will keep silence, and forget.”
</p>

<p>
Our departure from Moscow was like a flight.
I left a letter for Prilukoff, entreating him to forgive
and forget me, begging him not to debar me
from taking my way again towards safety and
rehabilitation. I expressed to him my sympathy,
my gratitude and regret; and I implored him in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the name of all that he still held dear or sacred
to return to his family and to his career, to the
lofty and straightforward course of honor from
which I, unhappy creature that I was, had unwittingly,
unwillingly turned him aside.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky took us to the Riviera—from the
snows of the north to the fragrant orange-groves
of Nice and Hyères. The tinkling of sleighs gliding
through the blue-cold streets of Moscow still
seemed to ring in my ears when, lo! the lazy, sun-warm
silence of the south enwrapped my senses
in its languorous sweetness. The two children,
dazed with the heat and the blueness around them,
stood in amazement, with hands clasped and
mouths open, at the sight of the golden oranges
and the huge foliage of cacti and aloes, thinking
that by some wonder-working charm they had been
carried into fairyland.
</p>

<p>
The distant sails, aslant on the radiant indigo
of the sea, looked like white butterflies poised on
a stupendous flower of lapis lazuli....
</p>

<p>
For three brief days I thought that fate had not
overtaken me, and that my sins would not find me
out.
</p>

<p>
My sins! As in the old German fable the children
are led into the depths of a forest, and left
there to be lost and forgotten—even so did I think
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
that my sins would be lost and forgotten, even so
did I think that they would never issue again from
the shade in which I had hidden them.
</p>

<p>
Smiling, I moved forward to meet the future,
exalted by the affection of an honorable man,
purified by the love of two innocent children.
</p>

<p>
And I said in my heart: “Fate is pitiful and
God has shown mercy. He has suspended His
judgment and has allowed me one last chance. I
shall not be found wanting; I shall be worthy of
His clemency.”
</p>

<p>
Then lo! at a turning in my pathway, the forgotten
avengers stand before me; my sins, like
spectral furies, have found me out!
</p>

<p>
We were finishing dinner on the terrace of the
Bellevue at Hyères, my betrothed and I. The
children had said good night, had kissed and embraced
us and run off, chattering and twittering
with Elise, to their rooms. Kamarowsky had just
lit a cigarette, and was leaning over to me with a
word of tenderness, when I perceived immediately
behind him at a neighboring table—a face, a grinning,
fiendish face.
</p>

<p>
My heart bounded. It was the Scorpion!
</p>

<p>
Why was it that name that first rushed to my
mind? Why was my primitive sense of fear and
repulsion renewed at the sight of him?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Ah, that man staring and grimacing at me over
Kamarowsky's shoulder was not the friend, the
lover, the knight of the heroic Saga whom I had
known and trusted in my days of desolation; no,
he was the terrifying and truculent monster of the
octopus story; he was the Scorpion who years ago
had filled my soul with dread.
</p>

<p>
When had he come? How long had he been
sitting at that table, watching my garrulous gladness,
my timorous, reawakened happiness?
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXVI
</h2>

<p>
I glanced at him apprehensively; I tried to
greet him, but he made no return to my timid salute.
He was smiling with a crooked mouth, his
arms crossed before him on the table. He was
mocking at Kamarowsky and at me, and my terror
seemed greatly to amuse him.
</p>

<p>
I rose nervously, wishing to retire, but Kamarowsky
detained me.
</p>

<p>
“What is troubling you, dearest?” he asked,
noticing my frightened eyes. And he turned to
see what was behind him.
</p>

<p>
I trembled in prevision of a stormy scene. But
the Count did not recognize Prilukoff; he had only
seen him once for a few moments that evening in
my drawing-room when he had brought me the
mysterious sealed envelope. Now Donat had his
hat on his head; and besides, with that sinister
smirk distorting his face I scarcely recognized him
myself.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we rose from the table, Prilukoff did
the same, and passing in front of us entered the
hotel before we did. I trembled, while Kamarowsky
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
with his arm in mine led me, talking
placidly and affectionately, towards the entrance
of the hotel. Doubtless he intended to accompany
me to my sitting-room. But what if we found
Prilukoff there?
</p>

<p>
It was Elise Perrier who saved me. As we
stepped out of the lift I saw her coming quickly
down the corridor to meet us.
</p>

<p>
“If you please, madame,” she stammered,
“there is a lady—a visitor”—her lips were white
as she uttered the falsehood—“who wishes to see
madame. She is waiting here, in the sitting-room,
and she would like to—to see your ladyship alone.”
</p>

<p>
“Who is it?” asked the Count.
</p>

<p>
“I think it is the—that relation of madame's”—Elise
was going red and white by turns—“that
relation from—from Otrada.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, I know,” I stammered breathlessly.
“Aunt Sonia, perhaps.” Then turning to Kamarowsky:
“Will you wait for me downstairs in
the reading-room?”
</p>

<p>
“Very well. Don't be long.” And Count
Kamarowsky turned on his heel and left us.
</p>

<p>
I went rapidly on in front of Elise, who, humiliated
by the falsehood she had told, hung her
head in shame both for herself and for me; and
I entered my sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
On the couch, smoking a cigarette, sat Prilukoff.
He did not rise when I entered. He sat there
smoking and looking at me with that curious
crooked smile. A great fear clutched my heart.
</p>

<p>
“Donat,” I stammered, “why did you not let
me know you had arrived?”
</p>

<p>
He made no answer; but he laughed loudly and
coarsely, and my fear of him increased.
</p>

<p>
“Did you receive my letter? Are you cross
with me?”
</p>

<p>
“Cross?” he shouted, leaping to his feet, his
eyes glaring like those of a madman. “Cross?
No, I am not cross.” I recoiled from him in terror,
but he followed me, pushing his distorted face
close to mine. “You ruin a man, you drive him
to perdition, and then you inquire whether he is
cross. You take an honorable man in your little
talons, you turn and twist him round your fingers,
you mold him and transform him and turn him
into a coward, a rogue, and a thief; then you throw
him aside like a dirty rag—and you ask him if he
is cross! Ha, ha!” And he laughed in my face;
he was ghastly to look at, livid in hue, with a swollen
vein drawn like a cord across his forehead.
</p>

<p>
I burst into tears. “Why—why do you say
that?” I sobbed.
</p>

<p>
“Why do I say that?” stormed Prilukoff.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
“Why? Because I had a wife and I betrayed her
for you; I had two children and I forsook them
for you; I had a career and I lost it for you; I was
a man of honor and I have turned thief for you.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, no!” I stammered, terrified.
</p>

<p>
“What? No? No?” he exclaimed, and with
trembling hands he searched his breast-pocket and
drew from it a bulky roll of banknotes. “No?
This I stole—and this—and this—and this—because
you, vampire that you are, needed money.”
</p>

<p>
“But I never told you to steal—”
</p>

<p>
“No, indeed; you never told me to steal. And
where was I to get the money from? Where?
Where?” So saying, he flung the banknotes in
my face and they fell all over and around me.
“You did not tell me to steal, no. But you wanted
money, money, money. And now you have got it.
Take it, take it, take it!”
</p>

<p>
I sobbed despairingly. “Oh, no, no, Donat!
Have pity!”
</p>

<p>
“I have had pity,” he shouted. “I have always
had pity—nothing but pity. You were ill and
miserable and alone, and I left my home in order
to stay with you. You wept, and I comforted you.
You had no money, and I stole it for you. How
could I have more pity?” He was himself in
tears. “And now, because I am degraded and a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
criminal on your account, you leave me, you fling
me aside and you marry an honest man. And I
may go to perdition or to penal servitude.”
</p>

<p>
“Do not speak like that, I implore you.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, but Countess Tarnowska, if I go to penal
servitude, so shall you. I swear it. I am a thief
and may become a murderer; but if I go to
prison, you go too.” He collapsed upon the sofa
and hid his face in his hands.
</p>

<p>
As I stood looking down upon him I saw as
in a vision the somber road to ruin that this man
had traversed for my sake, and I fell on my knees
at his feet.
</p>

<p>
“Donat! Donat! Do not despair. Forgive
me, forgive me! Go back, and return the money
you have taken; go back and become an honest
man again!”
</p>

<p>
He raised a haggard face in which his wild,
bloodshot eyes seemed almost phosphorescent.
</p>

<p>
“There is no going back. By this time all Moscow
knows that I have absconded, and carried off
with me the money that was confided to my care.”
</p>

<p>
“But if you go back at once and return it?”
</p>

<p>
“I am ruined all the same. I am utterly lost
and undone. Who would ever place their trust
in me again? Who would ever rely upon my
honor? No, I am a criminal, and every one knows
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
it. The brand of infamy is not to be cancelled by
a flash of tardy remorse. I am done for. I am a
thief, and that is all there is about it.”
</p>

<p>
A thief! I had never seen a thief. In my
imagination thieves were all slouching, unkempt
roughs, with caps on their heads, and colored
handkerchiefs tied round their throats. And
here was this gentleman in evening dress—this
gentleman who had been introduced to me as a
celebrated and impeccable lawyer, who had been
my lover, and Tioka's friend, and Elise's Lohengrin—and
he was a thief!
</p>

<p>
I could not believe it.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a voice was heard outside. It
was one of the bell-boys of the hotel; he was passing
through the corridor calling: “Forty-seven!
Number forty-seven.”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff started. “Forty-seven? That is the
number of my room. Who can be asking for me?
Who can know that I am here?”
</p>

<p>
In his eyes there was already the look of the
fugitive, the startled flash of fear and defiance of
the hunted quarry.
</p>

<p>
I looked round me at all the banknotes scattered
on the carpet, and I felt myself turn cold. “Hide
them, hide them,” I whispered, wringing my
hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
“Hide them yourself!” he answered scornfully.
</p>

<p>
I heard footsteps in the corridor. They drew
near. They stopped. Some one knocked at the
door. Terror choked my throat and made my
knees totter.
</p>

<p>
I stooped in haste to pick up all the money
while Prilukoff still looked at me without moving.
I held it out to him in a great heap of crumpled
paper. But still he did not stir.
</p>

<p>
Again the knocking was repeated. Who could
it be? Kamarowsky? The police? I opened a
desk and flung the bundle of banknotes into it.
</p>

<p>
Then I said, “Come in.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXVII
</h2>

<p>
It was only a saucy little page-boy in red
uniform.
</p>

<p>
“If you please, Count Kamarowsky sends word
that he is waiting for you.”
</p>

<p>
“Say that I shall be down directly.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” contradicted Prilukoff; “send word that
you are not going down.”
</p>

<p>
“But then he will come here.”
</p>

<p>
“You will say that you cannot receive him.”
</p>

<p>
And that was what took place. And not on that
evening only. Prilukoff installed himself, during
long days and evenings, in my apartments, and
refused to go away. Very often he did not even
allow me to go out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Then came Count Kamarowsky knocking at the
door.
</p>

<p>
“No! no! You cannot come in!” cried Elise
Perrier, pale and trembling, leaning against the
locked door.
</p>

<p>
“But why? Why? What has happened?”
</p>

<p>
“Nothing has happened. Madame is not feeling
well,” Elise would reply, in quavering tones.
</p>

<p>
“But that is all the more reason why I should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
see her,” protested the Count. “I must see her!”
</p>

<p>
“It is impossible!” And Elise, whom fear rendered
well-nigh voiceless, would roll towards me
her round, despairing eyes.
</p>

<p>
Then the Count would speak to me through the
closed door, entreating and arguing; and every
time he used a tender expression Prilukoff, who
held me fast, pinched my arm.
</p>

<p>
“Mura, Mura, let me in. Let me see you for
a moment. You know how I love you (pinch);
it is cruel to lock me out as if I were a stranger.
If you are ill let me take care of you, with all my
tenderness (pinch), with all my love (pinch)—”
</p>

<p>
In feeble accents I would reply: “Forgive me—I
shall soon be better—do not trouble about me.”
</p>

<p>
“But what is the matter? Why do you not
want to see me? Do you not love me any more?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes, I love—(pinch). Please, please go
away. I shall come down as soon as I can.”
</p>

<p>
Then I could hear his slowly retreating footsteps,
while Prilukoff glared at me and, on general
principles, pinched my arm again.
</p>

<p>
It was with the greatest difficulty that I could
conceal Prilukoff's presence from little Tioka.
</p>

<p>
One day the child caught sight of him seated on
the terrace, and, with a wild cry of delight, started
to run towards him. I caught him in my arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
“No, darling, no! That is not Prilukoff. It is
some one very much like him; but it is not our
friend.”
</p>

<p>
And as the man, with scowling countenance,
was gazing out at the sea, and paid no heed to us,
Tioka believed me, and, with a little sigh of regret,
ran in search of his playmate Grania.
</p>

<p>
The life Prilukoff led me in this grotesque and
unbearable situation is impossible to describe.
My days were passed in an agony of terror.
When I dined with Kamarowsky, Prilukoff invariably
took a seat at the next table, and I might
almost say that it was he who regulated our conversation.
If any subject were raised that was
distasteful to him—my approaching marriage to
Kamarowsky, for instance, or some tender reminiscence
which my betrothed loved to recall—Prilukoff,
at the adjoining table, made savage
gestures which terrified me and attracted the attention
of all the other guests. He would shake
his fists at me, glare at me with terrible eyes, and,
if I pretended not to notice him, he upset the cruet-stand
or dropped his knife and fork noisily to
attract my attention. He would stare at the unconscious,
slightly bald head of Kamarowsky, and
imitate his gestures with a demoniacal grin.
</p>

<p>
The guests of the hotel thought him insane, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
he certainly behaved as if he were. I myself have
often thought: “Surely he is a madman!” when
I came upon him suddenly, hidden behind the curtains
in my sitting-room, or crouching in a dark
corner, or lying on my bed smoking cigarettes. I
felt that my nerves and my reason were giving
way.
</p>

<p>
“What do you want of me, you cruel man?”
I sobbed. “What am I to do? Do you wish me
to tell everything to Kamarowsky? To break off
the marriage and return to Moscow with you?”
</p>

<p>
“We cannot return to Moscow, and you know
it,” growled Prilukoff.
</p>

<p>
“Somewhere else, then. Anywhere! I will go
wherever you like, I will do whatever you like.
Anything, anything, rather than endure this torture
any longer.”
</p>

<p>
“For the present we stay here,” declared Prilukoff,
who seemed to enjoy my anguish. “And as
for the future,” he added, rolling his terrible eyes,
“you can leave that to me.”
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he forbade me to go out with Kamarowsky.
At other times he followed us in the
streets, torturing me behind the unconscious back
of my betrothed, who marveled and grieved at my
extraordinary and frequently absurd behavior.
</p>

<p>
Early one morning, as I looked out of my window,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
I saw Kamarowsky standing on the terrace,
gazing thoughtfully out at the sea. I ran down
to him. We were alone. “Paul,” I whispered
hurriedly, “let us go away from here; let us leave
quietly, to-day, without saying a word to any one.”
</p>

<p>
He laughed. “What a romantic idea! Do you
not like this place? Are you not happy here?”
</p>

<p>
“No, Paul, no! There is some one spying upon
me.”
</p>

<p>
“Spying upon you?” he repeated, greatly
astonished. “Is that the reason of your strange
behavior?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, yes, but do not ask me any more questions.”
</p>

<p>
“Who is it? I must know who it is.”
</p>

<p>
“No, Paul. I will tell you later on. Hush!”
</p>

<p>
“You are a fanciful creature,” he said, laughing
and patting my cheek.

</div>

<p>
I felt hurt at his calm acceptance of what I had
told him, and wondered that he did not insist upon
knowing more. I reflected in my folly that if he
really loved me he ought to have been less satisfied
and secure. I did not understand—alas! I never
understood—his guileless and noble trust in me.
The insensate and exacting passion of others who
until now had dominated my life had spoiled me
for all normal affection. Hypersensitive and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
overwrought, I myself suffered unless I caused
suffering to those I loved; nor did I ever feel sure
of their love unless they doubted mine.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The love that varies not from day to day,</p>
<p>A tranquil love, unruffled and serene—</p>
</div>

<p>
was not the love I knew. My storm-tossed heart
did not recognize it. Neither on that day nor ever
could I bring myself to believe that Paul Kamarowsky
really loved me.
</p>

<p>
During those few moments that we were alone
together on the terrace, we arranged that I should
start with Tioka and Elise that very evening, during
the dinner hour, leaving all our trunks behind
us for my betrothed to see to after we had left.
He could join us three days later in Vienna, and
then we should all proceed to Orel, where important
affairs claimed his presence.
</p>

<p>
Half-way through dinner, as had been arranged
(and as usual Prilukoff sat at a table next to ours),
Elise entered the dining-room timidly and came to
our table.
</p>

<p>
“I beg your ladyship's pardon. Master Tioka is
outside and wishes to say good-night.”
</p>

<p>
“Bring Master Tioka in,” I said, trying to
speak naturally and raising my voice a little so
that Prilukoff should hear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
“I am sorry, my lady, but he refuses to come,”
and Elise hung her head as she spoke these words;
the treason we were perpetrating on Lohengrin
grieved her even more than the tortures that
Lohengrin had inflicted upon me.
</p>

<p>
“Pray excuse me a moment,” I said to Count
Kamarowsky, and rose from the table. “I shall
be back at once.”
</p>

<p>
No sooner was I outside the dining-room than
Elise threw my traveling cloak round me. A
motor-car was throbbing at the door, and in it
with beaming face sat Tioka surrounded by our
hand-bags and dressing-cases, shawls and hats.
</p>

<p>
“What are we doing?” he cried gleefully.
“Are we running away?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, darling,” and I clasped him to my heart,
as I sank into the seat beside him. The motor
was already gliding through the twilight roads towards
Cannes.
</p>

<p>
“But why? Why are we running away? Have
we stolen something?”
</p>

<p>
At those words my heart stopped beating. I
suddenly remembered Prilukoff's ill-gotten banknotes.
</p>

<p>
“Elise!” I gasped; “in the desk in my sitting-room—there
was some money.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, madame.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
“What did you do with it?”
</p>

<p>
“It is quite safe, madame. I have taken it.”
</p>

<p>
“<i>You have taken it!</i>”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, madame. Here it is.” And with satisfied
hand Elise patted a black leather satchel that
lay in her lap.
</p>

<p>
With a sob I hid my face in my hands.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, we had stolen something!
</p>

</p>

<h2>
XXVIII
</h2>

<p>
As soon as we reached the frontier I telegraphed
to Prilukoff. I wanted to send Elise back to
Hyères with the money, but she refused to leave
me.
</p>

<p>
“What if Mr. Prilukoff were to kill me,” she
cried. “Then what would your ladyship and poor
little Master Tioka do, all alone in the world?”
</p>

<p>
“But my good Elise, why on earth should Mr.
Prilukoff kill you?”
</p>

<p>
“I don't know,” sighed Elise. “But he has
become so strange of late—” and after a pause,
she added, under her breath: “We have all become
very strange.”
</p>

<p>
It was true. I could not but admit it. We were
“very strange.” We were not at all like other
people. The people that we met on our journeys
and in hotels, for instance, all took an interest in
external things—in the surrounding landscape, or
in works of art and monuments and cathedrals.
As for us, we never spoke about monuments. We
never entered a cathedral. We took no interest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
whatever in anything beyond our own dolorous
souls. We were even as those who travel with
an invalid, watching him only, caring for and
thinking of nothing else. The invalid I traveled
with was my own sick soul.
</p>

<p>
The least peculiar among us was Count Kamarowsky.
Yet even he, I fancy, was not quite like
other people. His was not a strong nature, like
that of some men I had known. Perhaps the
Slav blood is responsible for much that is abnormal
and unconventional. Surely we are from the
inmost depths of our nature strangely removed
from the Teutonic, the Anglo-Saxon and even the
Latin races, and our thoughts and actions must
frequently appear to them singular and incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
As for Paul Kamarowsky, his dread of suffering
was so great that he preferred to know nothing
that might cause him distress. In fear lest he
should see aught that might displease him, he
chose to shut his eyes to facts and truths, preferring
voluntarily to tread the easy paths of a
fool's paradise. I longed to open my heart to
him, to unburden my travailed soul and clear my
sullied conscience by a full confession; I was
ready to abide by the result, even if it meant the
loss of my last chance of rehabilitation, even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
should I forfeit thereby all hope of marriage with
a man of honor, rank and repute. But he closed
my lips; he sealed my heart; he firmly avoided
all confidences and disclosures.
</p>

<p>
“Mura,” he said, “my life and yours have been
too full of errors and of sorrow. Do not embitter
this, our hour of joy. The past is buried; let it
rest. Do not drag what is dead to the light of
day again.”
</p>

<p>
I bowed my head in silence. But in the depths
of my conscience I knew that my past had been
buried alive.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Not in my spirit alone did I suffer agonies at
this period; my frail body was racked with
disease and my sufferings were continuous and
intense. Day by day I felt my strength decline,
I saw myself wax thinner and paler; rarely indeed
did an hour pass that I could count free
from pain. The deep-seated ill that since the
birth of my little daughter Tania had struck its
fiery roots into my inmost being now bore its toxic
fruits, slowly diffusing its poison through my
veins. Sometimes the pangs I suffered were so
acute that I cried out in anguish, while beads of
cold perspiration started to my brow. But as a
rule I was tortured by a deep, dull, perpetual ache,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
a sense of utter weakness and weariness that
stifled all hope in me and all desire to live.
</p>

<p>
Oh, daughters of Eve, my purer and stronger
sisters, women who have not transgressed—you
whose hatred and scorn have overwhelmed me,
you whose white hands have been so quick to
throw the wounding stone—you alone can comprehend
the agony that racked my frame, the
flaming sword that pierced me, the sacred ill of
womanhood that girt my body as with a sash of
fire. You who in such dark hours can shelter
your sufferings in the protecting shadow of your
home, you who can seek refuge in a husband's
tenderness and hide your stricken brow upon a
faithful breast, can you not summon one throb of
sorrow to your womanly hearts, one gleam of pity
to your gentle eyes, when you think of the tortures
I dragged from hotel to hotel, seeking to
conceal my martyrdom from the inquisitive or
indifferent gaze of strangers, not daring to confide
in the man who loved me but who yet was almost
a stranger?...
</p>

<p>
Who can describe the minor and yet genuine
torment of the tight garments cramping the aching
body; the weight of the ornate head-dress on
the throbbing brow; the irony of rouge and
cosmetics on the ashen cheeks; and the nauseating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
distaste for the rich viands that one pretends
to enjoy while the noise of voices and music
pierces your brain, and the glaring electric lights
stab your aching eyes like a hundred knife-thrusts?
</p>

<p>
How often, on returning from some brilliant
banquet to the silence and solitude of a desolate
hotel bedroom, have I wept aloud with vain
longing for one great joy denied to me, one
supreme privilege of a happy woman: that of being
weary, ill, and miserable—and yet loved all
the same! How keenly have I envied some women
I have known—women who were not beautiful, not
brilliant and not young, but by whose sick-bed in
their hour of pain a husband watched in tenderness
and pity, faithful throughout the years,
throughout the changes that time brings, faithful
to the sad and pallid woman who had the right to
lay her faded cheek upon his breast.
</p>

<p>
None, none of those who vowed they loved me,
would have loved me thus! Not Vassili, not
Bozevsky, not Stahl, not Kamarowsky. Prilukoff
perhaps? Who knows?
</p>

<p>
But Prilukoff was a thief, a fugitive, a criminal;
and day and night I prayed that he might not
cross my path again.
</p>

<p>
He had not replied to my agitated telegram
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
informing him that Elise had unwittingly taken
the money away. Nor did he, as I thought he
would, join us in Vienna where we stayed several
days, expecting yet dreading his arrival.
</p>

<p>
We were at a loss to know what to do with his
stolen money. We did not dare to send it to him
at Hyères, where I knew he had been staying
under an assumed name and in constant terror
of discovery. We did not dare to leave it in our
rooms at the hotel. Elise carried it about with her
day and night in the hated black leather satchel,
which had become to us a nightmare, an incubus,
an obsession. With a bitter smile I recalled the
story of the English hunters in India who succeeded
in capturing that most precious and sacred
among all animals: a white elephant. And having
captured it they knew not what to do with it.
They trailed it after them across land and sea—ponderous,
slow, magnificent; and nobody wanted
it, and nobody knew what to do with it nor how
to get rid of it. Prilukoff's stolen money was indeed
a white elephant for us.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky with his little son had joined us
in Vienna, bringing all our luggage with him. He
was as boisterous as a schoolboy out for a holiday.
</p>

<p>
“There are no spies here, are there, Mura?”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
he laughed, kissing my cheek loudly. “No spies
to drive us away!”
</p>

<p>
Again I was hurt that he should thus make light
of the mysteries of my existence. Should he not
have demanded an explanation of my flight from
Hyères? Should he not have insisted upon knowing
who had followed me there? What love was
this that could voluntarily blindfold itself and
evade all explanations?
</p>

<p>
Not this, not this was the love I had dreamed
of and hoped for, the steadfast refuge for my
wavering spirit, the longed-for haven for my
storm-tossed soul.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
We proceeded almost immediately to Orel.
At this period I possessed no money at all of my
own; what little I had had when I left Moscow
had been spent; but not for a moment did I entertain
the thought of touching Prilukoff's ill-gotten
wealth. Paul Kamarowsky insisted upon
providing all our traveling and hotel expenses;
but it was embarrassing to be unable to tip a servant
or to pay for even the smallest trifle that
Tioka or I might want.
</p>

<p>
I made up my mind to lay frankly before my
betrothed my deplorable financial situation. And
I did so on the journey to Orel. He seemed much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
amused at my confession; and the fact of our utter
dependence upon him seemed to afford him the
greatest pleasure.
</p>

<p>
He filled my purse with gold, and made me
promise that I would always ask him for anything
I might need or desire.
</p>

<p>
How well I remember our arrival at Orel! It
was a radiant afternoon in October. Count Kamarowsky
accompanied us to our hotel, where flower-filled
apartments awaited us; then he left us at
once to go in search of a young friend of his, the
son of the Governor of Orel, who had promised to
see to our passports as soon as we arrived.
</p>

<p>
I was alone in our drawing-room when Elise
knocked at the door.
</p>

<p>
“The children would like to go out; they say
they feel cramped from the journey,” she said.
“If madame allows, I will take them into the park;
it is just opposite the hotel,” she added.
</p>

<p>
“Certainly, Elise.”
</p>

<p>
A moment later Tioka and Grania, ready to go
out, came running to embrace me, and behind them
Elise reappeared.
</p>

<p>
“If madame permits,” she said in a low voice,
“I might perhaps leave '<i>it</i>' here?”
</p>

<p>
“It” was the black leather satchel—our white
elephant.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
“Yes, yes; leave it,” I said.
</p>

<p>
And she carried it into my bedroom and placed
it on the dressing-table.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXIX
</h2>

<p>
I stepped out upon the balcony and watched
the children cross the sunlit square; they turned
and waved their hands to me; then I saw them
enter the park and scamper down the shady avenue,
the faithful Elise trotting quickly in their
wake.
</p>

<p>
I remained on the balcony wrapped in peaceful
thoughts, glad to feel the warmth of the autumn
sun on my shoulders and the coolness of the
autumn breeze on my cheeks. A wave of thankfulness
came over me; repentance for all my past
doubts and transgressions flooded my heart.
</p>

<p>
How could I ever have doubted Paul Kamarowsky's
love? Was not the absolute faith he reposed
in me—the blind unquestioning faith that in my
folly I had often resented—was it not after all the
highest homage that a noble heart could bestow?
Henceforth the aim of my life should be to render
myself worthy of his trust and love. In utter
gratitude and devotion my heart went out to him
who was about to place in my keeping the honor of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
his unsullied name, and the care of his motherless
child. I clasped my hands and breathed a fervent
prayer to Heaven, a prayer that I might deserve
the happiness that was in store for me.
</p>

<p>
A slight sound startled me from my reverie.
It was Kamarowsky who, having returned and
not finding me in the drawing-room, had knocked
at my bedroom door. Receiving no reply he entered.
I left the balcony, and closing the window
after me, stepped into the room.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky was standing in front of the dressing-table
holding the black leather satchel in his
hand.
</p>

<p>
“What is this?” he asked casually. “Is it
yours?”
</p>

<p>
The pitiless light from the window struck me
full in the face, and I felt that I was turning pale.
“No—no—” I stammered. “It is not mine.”
</p>

<p>
“I thought not,” he said, turning it round and
round. “I did not remember seeing it. We had
better send it down to the bureau of the hotel.”
And he stepped forward to touch the bell.
</p>

<p>
“No, no!” I cried, “it belongs to Elise.”
</p>

<p>
“Why does Elise leave her things in your
room?” Then noticing my pallor and agitation
he exclaimed: “Why, dearest? What is wrong
with you? You look quite white.”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f194"></a>
  <img src="images/194.jpg"
  alt="" />
<p class="caption">I STEPPED OUT UPON THE BALCONY</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
“It is nothing, nothing,” I said, attempting to
smile; and I sat down with my back to the light.
I was trembling from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
He bent over me with tender solicitude. “Are
you feeling ill?”
</p>

<p>
“Slightly—it will pass—it is nothing. The
fatigue of the journey perhaps,” and I caressed
the kind face that bent over me full of affectionate
concern.
</p>

<p>
He turned and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
A waiter appeared. “Bring some brandy,”
ordered Kamarowsky. “Make haste. The lady
is not well.”
</p>

<p>
The waiter returned promptly and placed the
tray on the table; as he was about to leave the
room Count Kamarowsky, who was pouring out
the brandy, said to him: “Wait a moment, you
can take that satchel upstairs to the maid's apartment.”
</p>

<p>
I sprang to my feet. “No—leave it,” I cried,
taking it from the waiter's hand. The man bowed
and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky seemed astonished at my behavior.
“What is the matter?” he asked. “Why are you
so agitated?”
</p>

<p>
“I am not—I am not agitated at all,” I
stammered, trying to control my features, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
holding the odious white elephant in my trembling
hands.
</p>

<p>
“What on earth is in that bag?” asked the
Count.
</p>

<p>
“Nothing—nothing,” I said, with a vacuous,
senseless smile.
</p>

<p>
“Come, now! It is full of papers,” laughed
Kamarowsky, putting out his hand and pressing
the satchel between his fingers. “Confess, what
are they? Love-letters?”
</p>

<p>
I contrived to answer his jest with a smile:
“You have guessed right,” I said.
</p>

<p>
“They are Elise's, I hope—not yours!” he
added, half smiling and half distrustful.
</p>

<p>
I laughed. “Elise's, of course;” and with a
deep sigh of relief I sank upon a chair, feeling
that the danger was past. But my heart had not
yet resumed its normal pulsation when the door
opened and the unwitting Elise appeared on the
threshold.
</p>

<p>
“We have returned, my lady, and the children
have gone upstairs.”
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky jestingly took the satchel from my
hand and dangled it in the air.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Elise! What have we got in here?”
</p>

<p>
Elise rolled her eyes wildly, and a scarlet blush
mounted to her face; Elise's blushes were always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
painful to see; now her face was of a deep damask
hue.
</p>

<p>
The Count laughed. “So this is where you keep
your love-letters, is it?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, sir,” exclaimed Elise, blushing till her
eyes were filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
“What? Is this satchel not yours?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, no, sir!—I mean—yes, sir,” stuttered
Elise.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky looked at her, and then at me.
Seeing the expression of our faces the laughter
faded from his lips.
</p>

<p>
“Come, Elise; tell me whose it is, and what it
contains.”
</p>

<p>
I attempted to make a sign to her, but the tall,
broad figure of Count Kamarowsky stood between
us.
</p>

<p>
I rose with a sigh of despair, acquiescing in my
fate. Now—let happen what may.
</p>

<p>
“What letters are they?” insisted Kamarowsky.
</p>

<p>
I heard the hapless Elise floundering in the
quicksands of falsehood; finally she let herself
drift—a helpless wreck on the rock of
truth.
</p>

<p>
“It is not letters, it is money,” she said at
last.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
“Money? Money of yours?”
</p>

<p>
“No.”
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence. Then Kamarowsky
said: “I do not believe you. I wish to see what
it contains.”
</p>

<p>
No one answered him.
</p>

<p>
“Where is the key?”
</p>

<p>
Again there was silence.
</p>

<p>
I heard a slight jingling sound; Kamarowsky
was searching in his pockets for a penknife. Then
he said to Elise: “You can go.”
</p>

<p>
Elise went slowly and reluctantly from the room.
Then I heard a faint tearing and crackling:
Kamarowsky had cut through the leather of the
satchel. Now the rustling of banknotes told me
that he was smoothing them out on the table, and
counting them.
</p>

<p>
A few moments passed.
</p>

<p>
“Thirty-five thousand rubles,” said Paul Kamarowsky
slowly. “I cannot understand why you
should have told me you were penniless.” There
was an icy coldness in his voice such as I had never
heard before.
</p>

<p>
“The money is not mine,” I said, in trembling
tones.
</p>

<p>
“Whose is it?”
</p>

<p>
How was I to answer him? Could I betray
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Prilukoff? And, with him, myself? I decided to
tell what was, intrinsically, the truth.
</p>

<p>
“I do not know whom it belongs to.”
</p>

<p>
Once more there was silence. I wondered what
he would do? Would he insult me? Would he
raise his voice in bitter accusation and reproof?
</p>

<p>
No. The silence remained unbroken. Kamarowsky
left the room without a word.
</p>

<p>
Ah! I was still in the grip of the octopus; its
tentacles bound and crushed me still. Even from
afar Prilukoff guided my destinies, drove my frail
barque into storm and disaster.
</p>

<p>
With trembling hands I gathered up the scattered
banknotes and thrust them back into the execrated
leather bag. Ah, if only I could have freed
myself from this nightmare burden, if only I could
have returned the money to Prilukoff! But how?
Where to? At the Bellevue, in Hyères, he had
called himself Zeiler. But now where was he?
Under what name was he hiding? How could I,
without warning, send him such a sum of money?
Where could I write to him?
</p>

<p>
No; fate had doomed me to wander through the
world carrying with me the hated money in Elise's
abominable satchel! At the bitterness of this
thought I dropped my face in my hands and wept.
</p>

<p>
I did not hear any one knock at the door; nor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
did I hear the door open. When, still shaken with
sobs, I raised my tear-stained face, I beheld standing
on the threshold a stranger—a slender, fair-haired
youth. He was gazing at me with compassionate
eyes, full of confusion at having found
me in tears.
</p>

<p>
“Pardon me,” he said, and his voice was soft
and musical.
</p>

<p>
“Whom do you want?”
</p>

<p>
“I was looking for Count Kamarowsky,” he
replied. “He has invited me to dine with him.”
There was a pause. “My name is Nicolas Naumoff.”
</p>

<p>
“My name is Marie Tarnowska.” And I gave
him my hand.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXX
</h2>

<p>
Count Kamarowsky came in shortly afterwards.
He was gloomy and morose; but on seeing his
friend, whom he had that morning invited to dine
with us, he made a heroic effort to keep up an appearance
of good temper and hospitality.
</p>

<p>
But his grief and anger were only too apparent.
He sat beside me at table without speaking
to me, nor did he ever turn his eyes in my direction.
</p>

<p>
Our guest seemed distressed and amazed at his
behavior, and—doubtless remembering my recent
tears—he gazed at me with his light-brown eyes
eloquent of sympathy and compassion.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice I addressed a remark to Kamarowsky,
but he scarcely answered me and I felt
myself flushing and paling with humiliation.
</p>

<p>
Silence fell upon us at last. Painful and embarrassing
as I felt it to be, I yet could find
no word to say. A violent headache racked my
temples, and I had to bite my lips to keep myself
from bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Suddenly I got up and went into my room.
With trembling hand I sought in my dressing-case
for a bottle of cocaine, which for nearly a year I
had not touched. I lifted it to my lips and sipped
the exhilarating poison. Then I returned to the
table.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky was sitting grim and silent with
bent head and lowering brow, but the young
stranger raised his golden eyes under their long
fair lashes, and fixed them upon me as if to give
me comfort. After a few moments, in order to
break the well-nigh unbearable silence, he spoke
to me in his low and gentle voice.
</p>

<p>
“I hear that Delphinus, the famous crystal
gazer, has arrived in Orel. You ought to get him
to tell you your fortune.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that so?” I said, smiling; and even as I
spoke the prediction of that strange soothsayer
flashed into my memory. I seemed to hear again
the brief, prophetic words: “<i>Two men are yet to
enter into your life. One will be your salvation—the
other your ruin.</i>”
</p>

<p>
Two men! I glanced around me, startled and
amazed. Two men were here; one on each side
of me. Was the prophecy coming true? Were
these the two men he had spoken of? Were the
One and the Other sitting beside me now?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
In my mind I could still hear the fortune-teller's
nasal, dreamy accent:
</p>

<p>
“You will chose—the Other. It is your destiny.”
</p>

<p>
Overcome by a feeling of timorous superstition,
I looked at my two table companions, of whom
One, perhaps, might represent my destruction, the
Other my last hope of happiness.
</p>

<p>
At my right hand sat Kamarowsky, sullen and
sinister in his grief and anger against me; on my
left the young unknown, with radiant face and
gold-bright eyes that smiled at me. A flash of intuition
seemed to illuminate my spirit; here was
salvation! Nicolas Naumoff! This unknown
youth, in whose eyes I had read such complete and
instant devotion—it was he whom fate had sent
to lead me back to joy.
</p>

<p>
Looking back to that hour I realize that it was
the rhapsodical delirium of cocaine that whipped
my brain into senseless aberration; but at the time
I implicitly believed that by a miracle of divination
I had rent the veil of the future, and could
discern with inspired gaze the distant sweep of
the years to come.
</p>

<p>
I saw Kamarowsky—somber, dark, with bent
head—as the very incarnation of sorrow and misfortune;
and, to make assurance twice sure, was it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
not he whom I had chosen? And had not the
diviner foretold me that he whom I chose would
be the one to lead me to destruction?
</p>

<p>
But I might still draw back, I might still trick
the Fates and escape from my predestined doom.
With the blind impulse of the hunted quarry seeking
a refuge, I turned an imploring gaze on the
young unknown; he read despair in my eyes, and
his own responded with a flash of comprehension;
he leaned toward me, and, as if in the throe of
some instant emotion, I saw him thrill from head
to foot like a tense string. At this immediate response
of his nerves to mine, I also felt a tremor
stir me, as the water of a lake is stirred by a gust
of wind. What evil spirit possessed me? Was
I ill? Was I demented? I cannot tell. I know
that my soul pledged itself to him at that moment;
and I know that he understood me.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in my attempt to escape it, the tragic
prophecy was to be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
When Nicolas Naumoff got up to take his leave
I knew that he would return, that I should see
him again, and this thought intoxicated me with
such delight that even Kamarowsky, in spite of his
anger and his suspicions, was swept away by the
radiance and rapture of my joyfulness. I was
then—well may I say it now!—at the zenith of my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
youthful beauty, notwithstanding, or perhaps by
reason of the disease that burned within me like a
consuming lamp; a constant fever lit my transparent
flesh into delicate rose flushes, and blazed
like lighted sapphires in my translucent eyes.
</p>

<p>
I was no sooner alone with him than, seeing me
thus aflame with radiant happiness, Kamarowsky
rose and came towards me with outstretched
hands.
</p>

<p>
“Marie, I love you, I love you! I will trust
you utterly. I want to know nothing that you
do not wish to tell me.” And he bowed his head
over my hands and kissed them.
</p>

<p>
But my wild thoughts went out to the unknown
youth with the golden eyes who had left us, he
through whom salvation was to come to me; and
every fiber yearned for his presence. A sudden
wave of almost physical repulsion for Paul Kamarowsky
overcame me and I started away from his
touch. “Leave me,” I cried, “leave me. Let me
go away.” And I tried to go past him to my
room.
</p>

<p>
But he stopped me, amazed and unbelieving.
“Why, dearest, why? What is the matter?”
</p>

<p>
“It is over,” I murmured incoherently, “leave
me. I do not wish to speak to you any more.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
I do not wish to marry you. I want to go away
and never see you again.”
</p>

<p>
“Mura! you are dreaming, you are out of your
mind! What have I done that you should speak
to me like this?”
</p>

<p>
His bewilderment and despair only irritated me
the more. “You will drag me to ruin and misfortune.
I was told so; and I know, I feel that
it is true.”
</p>

<p>
“You were told so?” gasped Paul. “What are
you saying? Mura, come to your senses. Who
has put such preposterous notions into your
head?”
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding my dazed and drugged state
of mind, I felt that to tell him about the fortune-teller
would neither convince nor impress him;
he would probably laugh, and try to coax or scold
me back to my senses. So I wrapped myself in an
obstinate and mysterious silence.
</p>

<p>
The unhappy man was perplexed and distressed.
</p>

<p>
“Who has poisoned your mind against me,
Mura? Think, think a moment; who in all the
world could love you more than I do? Who could
protect you and care for you better than I can,
poor helpless creature that you are?”
</p>

<p>
But I was possessed by the blind obstinacy of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
madness. <i>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</i>
My destiny was coming upon me at the
very time I thought to evade it.
</p>

<p>
“Let me be!” My hands twisted themselves
from his grasp. “I will not see you again! I
will not!”
</p>

<p>
“But I will,” cried Kamarowsky, clasping my
wrist in an iron grip, and his long, languorous eyes
opened wide and flamed into mine. “Do you
think that because I am kind and patient you can
play fast and loose with me? No indeed, no indeed;
you have promised to be mine, and I shall
make you keep your word.”
</p>

<p>
Never had I seen him like this nor dreamed that
he could be so fierce and resolute. I felt dizzy
and bewildered. I felt the bats of madness flying
in my brain. I raised my eyes with a scornful
smile to his: how could he keep me against my
will?
</p>

<p>
As if he had divined my thought he bent forward
with his passionate face close to mine. “Do
not think you can escape me,” he said. “Do not
imagine it for a moment. Mura, I know you well.
You need to be mastered, and I shall master you.
As long as I live, remember—as long as I live you
shall not escape me.”
</p>

<p>
These words seemed to pierce my dizzy brain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
like red-hot needles. “As long as he lives I shall
not escape him. <i>As long as he lives—!</i>”
</p>

<p>
I raised my eyes and looked at him; then I
drooped my lashes—and smiled.
</p>

<p>
The subtle cunning of madness stirred within
me.
</p>

</p>

<h2>
XXXI
</h2>

<p>
Paul Kamarowsky appeared not to notice it.
He continued to speak agitatedly, holding my unwilling
hand in his.
</p>

<p>
“I know, Mura, that you have done many unworthy
things in the course of your life; I know
that you are not what I would have you be; but
my pity for your misfortunes is far greater than
my resentment at your faults. I know that you
are ill; I know that you have had none but rakes
and reprobates around you; it shall be my duty
to strengthen you and uphold you with my love.
I will help you, Mura, whether you wish it or not;
I will save you in spite of yourself.”
</p>

<p>
Ah, miserable creature that I was, why did I
not throw myself upon his mercy and confide my
doubts and my despair to his generous heart?
Why did I not surrender my poor sick soul to his
keeping? This was indeed the last time that salvation
opened its haven to my shipwrecked soul; but
I knew it not, and like a boat adrift in the darkness
I swept on towards the storm.
</p>

<p>
He continued to speak. “If I have not wanted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
to know about your past, it has not been from
cowardice nor from the fear of any man; but from
distrust of my own heart, Mura, for fear lest my
love for you should wane. Whereas it is my duty
and my mission to love you, Marie Nicolaevna, to
love and save you from your own weakness and
the iniquity of the world. You are still so young—hardly
less of a child than little Tioka—notwithstanding
the storms of passion and sin that have
passed over your head. All you need is to live
among right-minded people who will love you. I
shall love you, Mura; and my mother, gentle soul
that she is, will take you to her heart; and so will
my sisters. Then when you find yourself surrounded
by such pure, kind and simple affections,
you, too, will become simple, kind and pure again.”
</p>

<p>
His voice broke. “We shall be so happy; and
Tioka and Grania will be happy; and so will your
good old father. He shall come and live with us.
How is it you never think of your father, Mura?
The generous, broken-hearted old man in that desolate
house of Otrada?”
</p>

<p>
Hot tears rushed to my eyes. My father!
My stately father, with his venerable white hair,
and his proud blue eyes—the “terrible O'Rourke,”
living in that deserted house, widowed, desolate
and alone. There was no one to coax him out of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
his grief or his anger; no arms went round his
neck, no laughing voices cried to him: “Father,
don't be the terrible O'Rourke!” I covered my
face with my hands.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky bent over me. “Is it not wickedness,
Mura, to throw away one's life as you do?
To rush from place to place, from emotion to emotion,
from misery to despair? Is it not more than
wickedness—is it not madness?”
</p>

<p>
“Madness!” As if the word had rent a veil
before my eyes, I looked my calamity full in the
face. Yes, it was madness; it was the hereditary
curse of my mother's people. I was like my
mother's two wild-faced, frenzied sisters, whom
we used to run away from and laugh at when we
were children, Olga and I.... Madness! In my
delicate blue veins it had taken root again, and
now its monstrous flower opened its crashing
petals in my brain. I was mad, there was no doubt
of it and no help for it. <i>I was mad.</i>
</p>

<p>
I spoke the words softly to myself, and the very
sound of them made me laugh. It amused me to
think that no one knew my thoughts. I felt like
a naughty little girl hiding in a dark cupboard
while everybody is looking for her. The dark cupboard
was my mind, and I had discovered madness
there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Undoubtedly I was bereft of reason; and my
mother's sisters, now for so many years entombed
in an asylum at Warsaw, were assuredly not more
mad than I. The thought of this, also, made me
laugh. I whispered to myself: “I am cleverer
than they. I am as mad as they are, but no one
shall ever know it!”
</p>

<p>
I have no other explanation to give, no other
justification. I was demented, and I knew it.
Sometimes in the night I started up wide awake,
and the horror of the thought that I was alone
with myself—with myself who was mad!—froze
me into a statue of ice. As soon as I could stir a
limb I would creep from my bed, steal out into the
silent corridors of the hotel, and run with chattering
teeth along the red-carpeted passages between
the long double rows of boots, which to my eyes
appeared like little monsters crouching at the
thresholds; then up the great staircase, turning
round every moment to look behind me, until I
reached the fourth floor and the room of Elise and
the children.
</p>

<p>
Softly I would tap at the door, and call:—“Elise!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, madame.” Elise Perrier always answered
immediately, as if she never slept.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, I want you.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
“Yes, madame, I shall come at once,” and I
could hear her rising from her bed.
</p>

<p>
Then I ran back through the silent corridors,
and when I passed Count Kamarowsky's door I
trembled and shuddered and felt constrained to
stop. I looked at his yellow boots—square and
placid, with their mouths open and their tongues
hanging out—and I experienced a wild sensation
of fear and loathing for him and for them.
</p>

<p>
I made a grimace at those hateful boots and
hurried away to shut myself in my room and await
Elise.
</p>

<p>
She would come in, pale and tidy in her red
woolen dressing-gown, with a little cap on her
head. She sat down quietly by my bedside and
held my hand. Sometimes she read aloud to me;
sometimes she repeated Swiss poems and ballads
that she remembered from her schooldays; and
I soon grew calm again as I listened to her quiet
voice and felt the clasp of her small roughened
hand on mine.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Gradually a sort of frenzied fear of Kamarowsky
took possession of me. I was obsessed continuously
with the idea that I must escape from
him at all costs, or die. My every fiber shrank
at the slightest touch of his hand. I longed never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
to see him again. I longed to know that the world
held him no more. It was a blind instinctive
frenzy that I endured without reasoning about it.
My constant and only preoccupation was to fly
from him who spelt ruin, and to cling to Naumoff,
my deliverer.
</p>

<p>
“Nicolas Naumoff! Nicolas Naumoff!” I repeated
his name all day long like a kind of exorcism
against Kamarowsky; sometimes I felt as if
I were stifled, as if I must hold my breath until he
was near.
</p>

<p>
On his side, Naumoff, who frequently came to
see us, was reserved and shy, and did not venture
to believe in what nevertheless he could not but
read in my eyes. Knowing nothing of my insensate
notion about the diviner's prophecy, and having
no conception that to my fancy he was a rescuer
sent to me by Providence, he thought I was
making fun of him; or at other times he believed
my predilection for him was merely the caprice of
a frivolous creature accustomed to gratify every
passing whim. So he held back, aggrieved and
mistrustful.
</p>

<p>
And the more he held back the more was I impelled
to pursue him, to hold and to vanquish him.
The passionate gravity of his youthful face delighted
me; I was thirsty for the unknown recesses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
of his soul as for a spring filled with mysterious
sweetness. His voice perturbed me; his silence
lashed my nerves; I lived in a perpetual quiver
of rhapsodic sensibility.
</p>

<p>
I was in this frame of mind when Kamarowsky
resolved to invite all his friends in Orel to a banquet
in order to announce to them our imminent
marriage.
</p>

<p>
At this banquet Naumoff also was present.
Doubtless he already knew the announcement
that his friend was going to make, yet when the
Count rose to speak and laid his hand with a
placid air of ownership upon mine, I saw Nicolas
Naumoff turn pale. I watched with deep emotion
the color slowly receding from his face; in its pallor
his youthful countenance appeared to me still
more beautiful; he looked indeed like the supreme
deliverer—the angel of death.
</p>

<p>
I did not comprehend a word of Paul Kamarowsky's
speech; I know that when it was ended
he turned to me and placed a magnificent diamond
ring upon my finger, and every one applauded and
cheered.
</p>

<p>
Then the guests rose in turn to congratulate
Kamarowsky, and to kiss my hand and wish me
joy; and I know that I smiled and thanked them.
</p>

<p>
Naumoff alone had not left his place, but in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
gay chatter and stir that surrounded us no one
noticed it. He soon went away; he disappeared
without taking leave of any one.
</p>

<p>
Toasts and speeches followed. The waiters
came and went, carrying fruits and wines and
sometimes leaving the large double doors of our
dining-room open behind them.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly as I raised my eyes I saw a man standing
on the threshold and gazing in at us.
</p>

<p>
It was Prilukoff.
</p>
</div>

</p>

<h2>
XXXII
</h2>

<p>
In truth I do not know whether I felt dismayed
or glad. It was as if I were in a dream.
</p>

<p>
Since I had begun to take cocaine again, that
twilight sensation of unreality had descended anew
like a misty veil upon all my perceptions.
</p>

<p>
I could not distinguish facts from illusions.
Prilukoff had immediately disappeared—or had I
only fancied that I saw him?
</p>

<p>
Trembling a little, I rose from my place, and
while many of the guests were still talking and
laughing with their host I excused myself on the
plea of fatigue. They toasted me a last time, and
Kamarowsky kissed me ceremoniously before them
all.
</p>

<p>
With cheeks and heart aflame I hurried to my
apartments, glad to think that I should find them
dark and silent. My temples were throbbing, the
coronet of diamonds—a gift of Kamarowsky's—weighed
heavy on my brow, and my eyes seemed
to be pierced with red-hot needles.
</p>

<p>
I opened the door of my sitting-room, where a
lamp, turned low, glimmered like a star veiled in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
red vapor. Behind it I could see yawning blackly
the open door leading to my bedroom, which was
in complete darkness.
</p>

<p>
I had a strange feeling that I was not alone.
Some one was in the room—some one whom I
could not discern was near to me.
</p>

<p>
Yes, a footstep approached; a strong arm encircled
me. Nicolas Naumoff's voice spoke in
thrilling accents: “Marie! Marie! My heart is
breaking.”
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of infinite weariness merging into
a sense of infinite repose I laid my head against
his breast. I longed to die. I felt as if I had
nothing more to ask for, nothing more to desire.
</p>

<p>
But the anguish that was passing from my soul
seemed to have entered into his.
</p>

<p>
“You must not marry that man! You must not,
you shall not!” He gripped my shoulders as if
he would crush them. “Tell me, tell me that you
do not love him.”
</p>

<p>
At that instant on the black background of my
bedroom there appeared a form—Prilukoff!
Erect in the doorway he stood watching us.
Naumoff had his back to him, but across his
shoulder I looked Prilukoff in the face, only a few
steps from me.
</p>

<p>
My heart stood still. What would he do?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Knowing as I did his ungovernable frenzies of
jealousy, his madness, his recklessness, I wondered
whether he would leap forward and spring
at Naumoff's throat? Would there be blows and
groans and a death-struggle in my tranquil,
shadowy room? Would there be a turmoil and
a scandal, during which the bond of infamy
that tied me to Prilukoff would be revealed to
Naumoff? Revealed to Kamarowsky and to the
world?
</p>

<p>
The fear of tragedy and disgrace kept me stark
and terror-stricken, rooted to the spot. Then I
saw Prilukoff move. Slowly he raised his right
arm. His right hand clutched something which I
could not see. Suddenly—incredible sight!—I
saw him open his mouth wide; and never, never
have I seen anything more grotesque and terrifying
than that figure in the darkness with mouth
gaping wide....
</p>

<p>
But still his right arm moved, rising slowly and
relentlessly until it was on a level with that terrible
open mouth. What did the hand hold? Did I not
see a gleam of polished metal?
</p>

<p>
I tried to scream, but no sound issued from my
parched throat. I could see the whites of his staring
upturned eyes, and the hand now motionless
just in front of the open mouth—
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
From my throat came a hoarse whisper: “Don't,
for heaven's sake! Wait—”
</p>

<p>
Naumoff, in amazement at these words which
he believed to be addressed to himself, relaxed his
hold. “What is it?” he whispered. “Is any one
there?”
</p>

<p>
Step by step I drew back from him, with my
fascinated eyes still fixed upon Prilukoff, who
stood motionless as a statue in the same dreadful
attitude.
</p>

<p>
“Is any one there?” repeated Naumoff.
</p>

<p>
“Yes. Don't move.” The words formed
themselves soundlessly on my lips, but Naumoff
understood them and obeyed. He neither turned
nor moved.
</p>

<p>
“Stand as you are,” I breathed; “do not stir.”
And I glided snake-like from him.
</p>

<p>
Then with the quickness of lightning I darted
upon Prilukoff, thrusting him back into the dark
bedroom, clutching him by the wrist, and covering
his rapid breathing with my hand. The carpet
deadened our footsteps. With my elbow I pushed
the door and, as it closed behind me, I turned
and shot the bolt. I was locked in my room with
Prilukoff.
</p>

<p>
“Hush, hush!” I whispered, my lips almost
touching his face. “I implore you, I implore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
you! Do not betray me. Do not let them hear
you.”
</p>

<p>
Through his closed and stifled lips there issued
hideous, incoherent words of vituperation.
</p>

<p>
“Hush! hush! hush!” I pressed my hand still
tighter to his lips. “Forgive me! Spare me! I
am yours, yours only! Donat, forgive me and
keep silence!”
</p>

<p>
“Mine, mine only,” breathed Prilukoff,
hoarsely; “you swear it!”
</p>

<p>
“Yes! oh, yes!”
</p>

<p>
I could hear Naumoff trying the handle on the
other side of the door.
</p>

<p>
“Marie! Marie! What are you doing? Why
have you run away?”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff's right hand was still uplifted, and now
he held it close to his temple. As I clutched that
hand I could also feel the cold contact with the
steel of a revolver.
</p>

<p>
“Do you swear that you will be mine forever?”
</p>

<p>
I murmured something inarticulate. Naumoff
was calling under his breath: “Marie! Marie!
Open the door.”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff raised his voice slightly. “Swear to
me that you loathe that man and the other; swear
that if I murdered them both you would still be
mine.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
“Yes, yes. Speak softly!”
</p>

<p>
“Swear it! Swear that they shall both die, that
you will help me to rid the world of them. Swear
it.” I could feel his hand tenser against his
temple, I could feel the first finger crooking itself
over the trigger. “Unless you swear,” hissed
Prilukoff, “I shall shoot myself here, this
instant.”
</p>

<p>
I did so. He repeated the words softly with
me: “<i>I swear—that—they shall die.</i>” And
something within me kept saying: “I am dreaming
all this.”
</p>

<p>
“That is not enough!” breathed Prilukoff.
“Swear it on the life of Tioka.”
</p>

<p>
My parched lips opened, but the iniquitous words
would not pass my throat.
</p>

<p>
Then Prilukoff pushed me from him and the
fingers of his right hand moved. I heard a slight
clicking sound. I threw myself forward.
</p>

<p>
“I swear it—”
</p>

<p>
And I swore it on the life of Tioka.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff's hand dropped to his side; he seemed
to reel slightly, and staggering backwards leaned
against the foot of my bed.
</p>

<p>
Naumoff on the other side of the door was growing
impatient. He shook the handle.
</p>

<p>
I bent over to Prilukoff. “Are you going to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
betray me? If I open this door, will you show
yourself?”
</p>

<p>
He laughed derisively. “Go along, go along,”
he muttered. And I opened the door.
</p>

<p>
“Why did you run away?” asked Naumoff, taking
my hand.
</p>

<p>
I closed the door behind me. I felt no more fear
of Prilukoff. I felt no more fear of any one or
anything. My heart seemed turned to stone.
And as I stood thus, some one else knocked at the
outside door. It was Kamarowsky.
</p>

<p>
And the door was not locked! I turned quickly
and blew out the lamp.
</p>

<p>
But Naumoff had taken a rapid step forward,
and turned the key in the lock. Then he stood
still, leaning against the door.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky outside heard him; and thinking
it was I, murmured softly: “Good-night! Good-night,
my darling!”
</p>

<p>
Then I was seized with a convulsive fit of
laughter. I laughed and laughed, shaken from
head to foot by a wild paroxysm of mirth. I could
not leave off laughing. I laughed until the laughter
became a spasm which racked and agonized me;
my teeth chattered, I trembled and quaked; and
still the hysterical laughter continued, shaking my
entire frame as an aspen is shaken by a brutal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
hand. I laughed and laughed, trying to laugh
softly in order that those three men standing in
the dark should not hear me.
</p>

<p>
The thought of the three men motionless behind
the doors made me laugh more than ever.
Tears ran down my face, my head felt as if it
would burst asunder. And still I rocked in the
throes of frantic laughter until body and soul
seemed to be shattered and rent....
</p>

<p>
I staggered and sank to the floor.
</p>

<p>
Naumoff bent over me. I felt his icy hands
passing over my face. Then we remained quite
silent in the dark.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, reluctantly Kamarowsky's footsteps had
passed away down the corridor....
</p>

<p>
I mustered strength enough to whisper to Naumoff:
“Go—send Elise to me—quickly!”
</p>

<p>
Naumoff obeyed.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Yes, Nicolas Naumoff—submissive soul!—has
always obeyed.

<h2>
XXXIII
</h2>

<p>
I was ill in bed for a long time. I lay supine
and motionless, feeling—as once, long before—as
if I were lying at the bottom of a well. In the
distance, far above me, life and the world went
whirling on; but nothing in me or of me stirred,
except that at every pulse-beat my life-blood
seemed to be gently, inexorably ebbing away. The
doctors bent over me with anxious faces; on my
body I felt the burning weight of ice; my arteries
contracted under the grip of ergot and chloride of
iron. Still slowly and inexorably I glided, as on
a smooth and shallow river, towards death.
</p>

<p>
Tioka and Grania had been sent to stay with
friends in Kharkov.
</p>

<p>
Naumoff came every day to ask for news, and
sent me flowers; but he was never allowed to see
me. Kamarowsky had permission to come into
my room for ten minutes every morning, but he
was not allowed to speak to me.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff, locked in my rooms, watched over me
night and day.
</p>

<p>
Nobody knew of his existence, for no one was
allowed to enter my apartment. How and when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
he slept and took his meals I do not know. Perhaps
Elise looked after that. He undoubtedly
grew thinner, more haggard and spectral every
day with sleeplessness, fasting and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Night and day he sat at my bedside watching
me. Sometimes, as I lay prostrate with closed
eyes, I said to myself that I must open them and
look at him; but so great seemed the effort of raising
my heavy eyelids, that frequently hours passed
and I could not do so. When at last I lifted my
leaden lashes, I saw him, always sitting motionless
beside me with his gaze fixed on my face. With
renewed effort I faintly contracted the muscles of
my face and attempted to smile at him. Then,
worn out with fatigue, I dropped my heavy lids and
my soul floated away again towards unconsciousness....
</p>

<p>
When I began to get better I noticed to my
amazement that Prilukoff talked to himself all the
time. Perhaps he had done so from the first, but
then I was too weak to understand or even to hear
him. Now that a little strength was coming back
to me each day, I could hear and comprehend the
words he uttered; it was a succession of imprecations,
of incoherent and disconnected maledictions
hurled against Naumoff and Kamarowsky, who as
he thought had snatched my heart from him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
would be the ruin and the death of me. I could
hear him murmuring:
</p>

<p>
“They must be got rid of; we have sworn it.
They must die.”
</p>

<p>
Towards evening his meager face grew red as if
with fever, and his mutterings increased, became
more rapid and excited. He would bend over me
with his nightmare face as I lay weak and helpless
on my pillows.
</p>

<p>
“They are outside there, in the corridor, both
of them. I can hear them walking up and down,
whispering together—talking about you. But they
are doomed, are they not? Irrevocably doomed.
You have sworn it. Tell me that it is so.”
</p>

<p>
I faltered “Yes,” hoping to silence him, but he
never ceased his uncanny mutterings; and the idea
of murder completely possessed his disordered
brain. Elise, moving like a little frightened ghost
through the locked and darkened rooms, frequently
attempted to come to my aid.
</p>

<p>
“Go away; leave her alone,” she would say to
Prilukoff. “Do you want her to fall ill again?
Why don't you go to sleep? Why don't you eat?
Why don't you go out?”
</p>

<p>
But Prilukoff stared at her with vacant eyes,
then went into the dining-room and drank some
vodka, and soon he was bending over me again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
“Mind, I am not going to do it alone,” he whispered,
“so that afterwards you would be afraid
and horrified of me. No, no. You shall help me.
You shall attend to one, and I to the other.”
</p>

<p>
By degrees, as strength returned to me and dispelled
the torpor that had numbed my brain, I
understood Prilukoff's ravings, and was aghast at
them. Absorbed in his monstrous dream, he delighted
in planning all the details of the double
crime.
</p>

<p>
“What I want is to be alone with the man I saw
holding you in his arms the other evening.” He
ground his teeth. “As for your betrothed, you
shall give him a dose of curare or atropine. An
exquisite wedding cup for the bridegroom!”
</p>

<p>
Then I burst into tears of terror and weakness,
while the indignant Elise, hastening to my aid,
would grasp Prilukoff's arm and compel him to
leave me. He would sit gloomily in a corner, or
go into the adjoining room, but a little while
afterwards he was there again, raving as before.
</p>

<p>
“Elise,” I whispered to her one evening, “I am
afraid, I am terribly afraid of him.”
</p>

<p>
“Shall I tell some one about it? Shall I tell
Monsieur the Count?” exclaimed Elise.
</p>

<p>
“No, no,” I cried.
</p>

<p>
“Might I—might I tell Monsieur Naumoff?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
I hesitated; but when I recalled those golden
eyes that turned to me filled with such trust and
adoration I shook my head. “No, tell no one,
Elise, tell no one.” And I hid my face in the
pillows.
</p>

<p>
At last a day came when I was able to be up for
an hour, and it was no longer possible to prevent
Kamarowsky from coming to see me. Prilukoff
refused to go away; I could not get him to stir
from my room. At last, having compelled me
to repeat the abominable vow, having forced me
to invoke once more the seraphic image of little
Tioka as tutelar genius of a monstrous crime, he
went away, passing through my dressing-room to
an outer passage at the back of the hotel.
</p>

<p>
Elise dressed me and placed me in an armchair
near the window, where I reclined, trembling and
weak. Then I sent word to Count Kamarowsky
that I would see him.
</p>

<p>
He came in full of emotion and joy. “At last,
at last you are better,” he cried, his kind eyes
alight with pleasure. “But how pale you are, how
dreadfully pale.” And bending over me, he kissed
my hair with infinite tenderness.
</p>

<p>
As I saw him standing before me, smiling and
well, the murderous ravings of Prilukoff and my
own iniquitous vow seemed but a figment of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
my morbid fancy, a half-forgotten illusion of my
delirium, dissolving and fading away like a dark
dream at daylight.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky held my hand tightly clasped in
his, as if he were half afraid I might vanish from
him. “What a poor little blue-white hand!” he
said. “You have become quite transparent,
Mura; I think I can look right through you and
see your soul, trembling and flickering like a little
flame!”
</p>

<p>
I smiled at him. All my morbid fear and dislike
of him, even as all my sudden insensate
infatuation for Naumoff, was spent. Nothing
remained of the storm my soul and senses had
passed through but a limitless weakness and
languor. I yearned to rest, to sleep, to sink out
of life and be no more....
</p>

<p>
A few moments later they announced Naumoff,
who had brought me some roses. I was neither
glad nor sorry to see him. Punctually when an
hour had elapsed Elise Perrier sent my visitors
away and put me to bed again.
</p>

<p>
I fell asleep almost immediately.
</p>

<p>
When I reopened my eyes, twilight filled my
room with shadows and there was Prilukoff,
sitting beside my bed, talking to himself about
murder, revenge and poison.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
</p>

<h2>
XXXIV
</h2>

<p>
Every day my fear of Prilukoff increased. I
had only one thought—to escape from him, to go
far away where he could never find me; better still,
to hide with Tioka and Elise in some distant spot,
where neither this terrible maniac nor yet Naumoff,
nor even Kamarowsky, could ever reach me.
</p>

<p>
I thought of Otrada, my home. But how could
my unhappy father protect me against the loving
persistence of Kamarowsky, against Naumoff's
passionate daring, or Prilukoff's diabolic designs?
</p>

<p>
In the rare moments when I was alone with
Elise, we talked it over. In trembling whispers,
glancing constantly round lest the Scorpion should
be on the watch, we concerted the manner of our
flight.
</p>

<p>
We made a thousand different plans, all equally
extravagant and impracticable. In our luxurious
hotel rooms we were imprisoned like mice in a
trap. We never opened a door without finding
a maid awaiting our orders, or a zealous and obsequious
waiter bowing to us, or Kamarowsky
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
asking for news, or Naumoff waiting with a
bunch of flowers in his hand.
</p>

<p>
We closed the door, and found ourselves shut
up with Prilukoff, ferocious and maniacal, who
glowered at us with the eye of a tiger.
</p>

<p>
A thousand times in my weakness and despair
I was on the point of throwing the door wide open
and calling for help—calling Kamarowsky and
Naumoff, and crying to them: “Look! a man is
shut up in here. For days and days he has been
torturing and threatening me. The man is a criminal
and a thief, and he has been my lover. Save
me from him!”
</p>

<p>
But then I pictured to myself the scene of violence
that would follow, the room echoing with revolver
shots; and at the mere thought of it, in my
weak and exhausted state, I fell into long fainting
fits from which Elise had the greatest difficulty in
reviving me.
</p>

<p>
One morning Elise had an idea: “Let us confide
in the doctor.”
</p>

<p>
I agreed. But the thought agitated me so
that when the doctor came he found me trembling,
with a rapid, irregular pulse and panting
breath.
</p>

<p>
“Doctor—” I began.
</p>

<p>
“Ah, but this is bad, very bad. What is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
meaning of all this agitation? Did you sit up too
long? If you are not a better patient, I shall have
to complain of you to my friend Paul.”
</p>

<p>
His friend Paul! True. He was a friend, an
intimate friend, of Kamarowsky's. How could
I ever have had the idea that he would keep our
secret, that he would not betray my intended
flight? It was a crazy notion of Elise's. I cast
a significant glance at her, and was silent.
</p>

<p>
He prescribed bromides and recommended absolute
rest of body and mind. Scarcely was he gone
when to my astonishment the long curtain that
hung in front of an alcove where Elise kept my
dresses moved slightly. Then they parted, and
Prilukoff appeared.
</p>

<p>
Ah! he had not gone out as he had pretended
when the doctor had been announced! He had
hidden himself. What if I had spoken?
</p>

<p>
My fear of him turned to frenzy: I thought him
endowed with supernatural powers. My room
seemed to be filled with innumerable Prilukoffs
peering out at me from every corner. I clung to
Elise. “We must go away, we must go away
to-morrow,” I whispered. “Do you understand?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, madame,” was Elise's firm and humble
reply.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
“Send to fetch little Tioka; send for him at
once.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, madame.”
</p>

<p>
Later, while she was dressing me, she stooped
to draw on my stocking—Prilukoff was reading in
the adjoining room—and she murmured:
</p>

<p>
“We have no money to travel with.”
</p>

<p>
“You must ask Count Kamarowsky for some;
he will give you all we want,” I whispered.
</p>

<p>
“Not without asking what it is for. We shall
need a great deal.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Elise, think, think of something,” I sighed,
and felt myself turning faint.
</p>

<p>
“What are you two mumbling and plotting?”
growled Prilukoff's voice from the adjoining
room.
</p>

<p>
We were silent.
</p>

<p>
Tenderly and anxiously assisted by Kamarowsky
and Elise I went down to the terrace that
day, and spent the afternoon reclining on a couch
in the mild spring sunshine, with eyes closed and
every limb relaxed. I thought of our impending
flight. Kamarowsky, seated beside me, kept silence,
thinking I was asleep.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards I heard Tioka's quick little
footsteps running across the terrace towards us.
Kamarowsky doubtless warned him to keep very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
quiet, for I heard him stepping nearer on tip-toe,
and without a word he clambered on to Kamarowsky's
knee and laid his fair head confidingly
against his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Beneath my drooping lashes, I gazed at them,
and thought of the hideous plot that was weaving
itself round this kind and generous man, who all
unknowing pressed forward towards treachery
and death; and I thought of the iniquitous oath
which had placed a circlet of blood round that fair
childish head.
</p>

<p>
With a sob I raised myself and stretched out my
arms to them both.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
It was eleven o'clock on the following night.
Elise put out the lights and prepared the bromide
and water on my little table. Prilukoff
was rambling backwards and forwards between
bedroom and drawing-room, smoking a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
“Elise,” I whispered. “Are we ready?”
</p>

<p>
Elise nodded.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, when? When is it to be?”
</p>

<p>
“Hush, madame. Later on, towards morning;
as soon”—with her head she indicated Prilukoff—“as
soon as he is asleep.”
</p>

<p>
“But he never sleeps, Elise!”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Elise looked at me. “He will sleep to-night,”
she said; and there was an icy hardness in her
tone that I had never heard before.
</p>

<p>
“Why will he sleep? How can you know?”
</p>

<p>
Before she could answer, Prilukoff reappeared
in the doorway. He had a glass of vodka in his
hand.
</p>

<p>
“This accursed throat!” he said, throwing his
cigarette away and putting his hand to his neck.
“Everything I swallow burns and scratches me.”
He coughed and cleared his throat. “You can go,
Elise. I shall see to anything your mistress
needs.”
</p>

<p>
Elise did not reply. With a hard, pinched face
she poured the water into my glass and dropped
two little bromide tablets into it. Then with her
back turned to Prilukoff she fixed her eyes upon
me and moved her lips: “<i>Do not drink.</i>” She
formulated the words clearly but without sound.
I stared at her in bewilderment, and she made the
movement with her lips again: “<i>Do not drink
anything.</i>” Then seeing that, notwithstanding
my astonishment, I had understood her, she said
respectfully: “Good night, madame,” and left
the room.
</p>

<p>
She went out by the bath-room door, of which
she always kept the key.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
Prilukoff dropped into an armchair and yawned.
“This accursed throat,” he repeated.
</p>

<p>
He poured out a glass of water from the crystal
carafe on my table and swallowed it at a gulp.
Then he coughed violently.
</p>

<p>
“The devil!” he exclaimed. “This too! It
tastes like some beastly concoction of—of chloral.”
He coughed and yawned again. Then he leaned
his head against my bed. A few moments later
he started up.
</p>

<p>
“The devil!” he repeated, rising to his feet. I
saw him go to the little table on which Elise every
evening left some coffee ready on a spirit lamp;
he lit it, and I dreamily watched the thin blue
waverings of the flame. While the coffee was
heating Prilukoff constantly cleared his throat,
with the same murmured oath. Now he poured
the smoking coffee into a cup and sipped it. “By
all the infernal powers—” he cried, and turned
suddenly to look at me.
</p>

<p>
I did not dare to shut my eyes, much as I should
have liked to do so. He came up to my bed and
bending over me looked me in the face. Then he
touched my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
“See here!”
</p>

<p>
I drooped my eyelids drowsily. “Yes, dear!
What is it?”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
“Just taste this coffee,” and he pushed the cup
against my lips.
</p>

<p>
I sat up and with a smile took the cup from his
hands.
</p>

<p>
“It burns,” I said, barely touching it with my
lips and making a little grimace.
</p>

<p>
“Drink it!” he roared in a terrible voice,
though his eyes were half shut as if he could not
keep awake.
</p>

<p>
I took a sip of the coffee: it scraped my throat
like a rake. I thought of Elise and understood.
For a moment the idea flashed through my brain
to say that I found nothing the matter with it.
Then I changed my mind.
</p>

<p>
“Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “What have
they put in this coffee? It tastes like poison!”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff bent still closer over me.
</p>

<p>
“If you had said it was all right, I should have
strangled you.”
</p>

<p>
My teeth chattered, partly through the taste of
the chloral, partly through my fear of Prilukoff.
</p>

<p>
“Have you drunk much of it?” I gasped.
“You ought to call for help.”
</p>

<p>
But Prilukoff had sunk into an armchair, and
already, with his head rolled back and his mouth
open, he slept.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>

</p>

<h2>
XXXV
</h2>

<p>
How did we three hapless, terrified creatures
manage to escape from the hotel that night?
</p>

<p>
Tioka, wakened out of his sleep at three o'clock,
kept on whimpering.
</p>

<p>
“Where are we going? I am afraid. I want
Papa Paul! Call Papa Paul.”
</p>

<p>
As we descended the dark staircase a night
porter, dozing in the hall, started up and came towards
us, blinking and yawning. When he caught
sight of Elise, laden with shawls and medicine
bottles—which constituted all our luggage—he
seemed greatly astonished.
</p>

<p>
For a moment no one spoke. Then: “I am
feeling ill,” I said. “We are going to the doctor.
Please call a carriage for me.”
</p>

<p>
“But excuse me, madame,” stammered the man.
“Had I not better telephone to the doctor to come
to the hotel?” His eyes wandered suspiciously
from me to the lachrymose Tioka, and from Tioka
to Elise and her burdens.
</p>

<p>
“Open the door,” said Elise authoritatively,
“and call a carriage, at once.”
</p>

<p>
The man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
Then I saw Elise gather all the shawls into a
heap on her left arm, as with her right hand she
searched for something under her cloak. She
drew out a crumpled piece of paper, and with a
gesture of solemn deliberation she proffered it to
the man. It was a banknote of a hundred rubles.
</p>

<p>
The man took the note, stared at it, and turned
it round and round in his fingers. Then he raised
his eyes and gazed in stupefaction at Elise.
</p>

<p>
“Open that door and call a carriage,” commanded
Elise, in a thin voice.
</p>

<p>
The man obeyed. As the large door swung back
we could see that it was nearly dawn; the sound
of distant church bells came to us across the clear,
keen air. Elise raised her hand to her forehead
and made the sign of the cross.... She had
plundered the white elephant!
</p>

<p>
Oh, Elise Perrier, not least among my great
pangs of remorse is the thought that I have
dragged you down into my own dishonor. For
me and through me, your honest hard-working
hand and your innocent soul were stained with
guilt.
</p>

<p>
While we stood waiting for the man to return,
I thought I heard a door open and close overhead.
</p>

<p>
I started. “Could it be Prilukoff?” I gasped
to Elise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, what have you done to him?”
</p>

<p>
“I put chloral into everything—into everything,”
and Elise shuddered.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Elise! What if he were to die?”
</p>

<p>
She made no answer.
</p>

<p>
“And if we were to be sent to prison?”
</p>

<p>
The bells were ringing joyfully in the limpid
Easter dawn.
</p>

<p>
Elise closed her eyes, and her lips moved:
“Dear God of Eastertide, give us Thy blessing.”
</p>

<p>
Tioka stopped crying to look at her. Then with
an enchanting smile he did as she had done. He
closed his blue eyes, which were still full of tears,
and said: “Dear God of Eastertide, give us Thy
blessing.”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The days swung forward.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff was the first to discover us. We had
been hidden in Vienna, in the little Hotel Victoria,
less than a week, when one morning he stood before
our terror-stricken eyes.
</p>

<p>
He was derisive and sarcastic; but finding us
alone—without Kamarowsky, without Naumoff—the
maleficent frenzy that possessed him at Orel
seemed to have vanished. He was soon quite
genial and good-humored; he was once more the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
Prilukoff we had known at Moscow, the trusty
knight—Elise's Lohengrin!
</p>

<p>
He did not speak of the past; he made no allusion
to the chloral. Neither did he ever recall his
murderous purposes; and sometimes I thought
that I had dreamt it all. Cheerful and light-hearted,
he took us out for drives in carriages and
motors, to the Prater, to the Brühl, to the Semmering;
he insisted upon our going with him to
theaters, concerts and cabarets.
</p>

<p>
And to pay for it all we had recourse to the
black leather satchel. When any money was required,
we found it there. No accounts were kept.
Simply, and as a matter of course, we dipped into
the lacerated body of the white elephant and took
what we needed.
</p>

<p>
I let myself drift with the tide; I gave no
thought either to the future or the past, but
yielded myself passively to my fate like a straw
afloat on the water....
</p>

<p>
One day I saw in the newspapers that Kamarowsky
was putting in motion the police of every
city in Europe in his efforts to find me. Then,
on Prilukoff's advice, I sent Elise to Neuchâtel to
telegraph to him from there in my name, in order
to tranquilize him and mislead his inquiries.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was the name of Kamarowsky mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
between us than Prilukoff became sullen
and gloomy again. He sulked and glowered at
me, and passed the whole day without speaking a
word.
</p>

<p>
On this particular day we had taken a box at
the <i>Theater An der Wien</i>, having promised Tioka
that he should hear “The Merry Widow.” Long
before it was time to go, the little fellow was
dressed and ready, jumping up and down in front
of the window.
</p>

<p>
“Let us make haste,” he cried. “The carriage
will be tired of waiting. Let us make haste!”
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he uttered a shriek of joy. “Mother,
mother, look! There is Papa Paul! I can see
him—he has just passed. Papa Paul!” he
shouted with all his might.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff caught him by his little jacket and
drew him roughly from the window. Then he
himself looked out.
</p>

<p>
“Sure enough,” he said, shutting the window
and looking at me with that terrible crooked smile
I had learned to dread. “It is Kamarowsky.”
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence. Then he said:
“And now I have had enough of this. We will
end it.” Murder gleamed in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
I clasped Tioka in my arms—the child was quite
sad and hurt by Prilukoff's sudden rudeness—and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
as I kissed his soft curls I breathed Elise's prayer:
“Dear God of Eastertide, give us Thy blessing.”
</p>

<p>
But alas! it was Easter no longer.
</p>

<p>
In spite of what had happened, we went to the
theater that night. And there, while the music
swayed us in the undulating rhythm of the waltz,
and little Tioka gazed enraptured at the stage,
Prilukoff, sitting behind me in the shadow, formulated
his plans for the crime.
</p>

<p>
“You have sworn it on your child, remember.
If you break your oath, he will be the sufferer.”
</p>

<p>
Tioka turned to us with shrill laughter. “Oh,
look, mama, how beautiful it all is! Look at that
fat policeman dancing.”
</p>

<p>
“When Kamarowsky finds you here—” Prilukoff
went on; but I interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
“No, no. Let us leave Vienna at once.”
</p>

<p>
“It is useless. He will find us all the same.
You are too striking,” he added, “to pass unobserved.”
And with a cynical laugh he surveyed
me from head to foot. “He had better not find
me with you. I shall remain at the Hotel Victoria;
but you and Tioka must go to the Bristol,
and when that man joins you, this is what you
must do—”
</p>

<p>
His iniquitous suggestions floated on the buoyant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
waltz music like carrion on the surface of a
sparkling stream.
</p>

<p>
I shuddered in horror. “No, no,” I murmured.
“Have pity! No ... no!”
</p>

<p>
Oh! that music of Lehar's, that every one knows
and every one whistles, and that is played by every
organ at every street-corner—what monstrous
secrets does it murmur to my heart!
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Ich gehe zu Maxim,</i></p>
<p><i>Da bin ich sehr intim...</i></p>
</div>

<p>
The joyous verses ring in my ears like the
shrieks of maleficent Furies, scourging me with
nefarious counsels and diabolic commands....
</p>

<p>
And while little Tioka laughs and claps his
hands, I, his mother, sink ever deeper and deeper
into the gulf of despair; and crime, like a sea of
mire, closes its corrupt waves over my head.

<p>
Everything came about as Prilukoff had foreseen.
Kamarowsky found me the following evening
alone with Tioka at the Bristol Hotel. He
overwhelmed me with reproaches and with endearments.
</p>

<p>
I maintained a mysterious silence, which he interpreted
merely as the caprice of a spoiled child;
nor did he take umbrage at it. He was too happy
at having found me to care to quarrel either with
the Fates or with me. All he said was: “Marie,
I shall not leave you again.” And the promise
sounded almost like a threat.
</p>

<p>
For some time Prilukoff gave no sign. I might
have thought he had forgotten me. He had fixed
a definitive space of time: ten days.
</p>

<p>
On the eighth day he sent me a note, telling me
to come to the Hotel Victoria that evening at nine
o'clock. He would then provide we with what was
needful. I was not to fail—or he would come himself.
</p>

<p>
I dined with Paul Kamarowsky as usual; then,
pleading a headache, I retired to my room at eight
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Half an hour later a closed carriage was conveying
me to the Hotel Victoria.
</p>

<p>
From Prilukoff's hands I received a syringe,
two tiny bottles, and a box filled with globules of
curare, nitrate of amyl and chloroform. From
his set gray lips I received instructions how to use
these things. His teeth were chattering as well
as my own; his hands were ice-cold and his eyes
distraught.
</p>

<p>
Then I fell on my knees at his feet. I implored
him with all the strength of desperation to forego
his abominable purpose. I reminded him of his
past, of his unsullied youth, of the kind and generous
love that had at first bound him to me; with
tears streaming down my face I clung to his knees
and swore to him eternal gratitude, eternal devotion,
if only he would not stain my soul with crime,
if only he would not ruin himself forever with so
dark and vile a deed.
</p>

<p>
I beat my forehead against his feet, entreating
of him death for myself, but pity, pity for a generous,
chivalrous man whose only wish was to
protect and save me.
</p>

<p>
What heaven-inspired words were granted me
that I was able to move him? I cannot tell; but
suddenly a great shudder went through him and
agonized sobs shook his frame. He bent down
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
and raised me. Then he sank into an armchair
and wept aloud with uplifted face, a terrible spectacle
of anguish and desolation.
</p>

<p>
I also wept, kneeling beside him, kissing his
hands, thanking him, blessing him.
</p>

<p>
“Donat, dearest, do not weep! It has been all
a dream—a fearful dream. We were ill—we were
poor demented creatures. God will not remember
it—He will cancel and forgive everything. Let us
thank Him, Donat, for not permitting us to do
harm to any one. Let us begin life all over again—a
new, honorable life.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, no,” groaned Prilukoff. “I am a criminal.
I have stolen!”
</p>

<p>
“Never mind, never mind. You will give it
all back. I will help you to give it all back. We
must be prepared to face suffering and humiliation,
but we shall atone; we shall take up our lives
again, and retrieve and redeem the past.”
</p>

<p>
Even while I spoke I resolved that I would confess
everything to Kamarowsky, and this thought
filled me with joy. I would reveal to him the darkest
recesses of my soul; I would confess the
iniquitous treachery plotted against him, my every
act of baseness and of shame. He would drive me
from him in loathing, he would tread me under
foot like some poisonous thing, but I would bow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
my head beneath his wrath and his disdain. I
would go far away and live the rest of my life in
humility and penitence. I would perhaps link my
fate with that of Prilukoff, the degraded outcast
... yes, my penance should be to stay forever
with him who inspired me now with so much horror
and fear....
</p>

<p>
Carried away by an ecstasy of feeling, we knelt
down in that paltry hotel-room and thanked God
for having opened our eyes, for having touched
our hearts, for having saved us. Then praying
aloud: “<i>Lord, let not our sins be counted against
us</i>...” we broke the syringe and the phials of
poison into a thousand fragments. Prilukoff tore
the flesh of his hands as he snapped the hollow
steel needle, which thrust itself into his palm like
some fierce, living thing. “<i>Blot out our transgressions
and remember not our iniquities</i>...”
We trampled on the globules of amyl and chloroform,
setting free the lethal vapors, which turned
us giddy. Intoxicated with them and with our
own emotions we fell once more on our knees,
praying with uplifted hands: “<i>Deliver us from
our sins</i> ... <i>of Thy mercy save us</i> ... <i>save
us</i>...”

<h2>
XXXVII
</h2>

<p>
I remember that once in our childhood we were
by the sea—I cannot tell in what country we were,
nor what sea it was—and our English governess
took us out one morning on the beach to see a
tidal wave.
</p>

<p>
“What is a tidal wave, Miss Williams?” we
inquired.
</p>

<p>
“Two or three immense waves which only come
once a year,” replied the sibylline Miss Williams.
“Now keep quiet and look.”
</p>

<p>
We kept quiet and looked. And presently we
thought we could see a huge wave, larger than all
the others, coming towards us from the horizon.
</p>

<p>
“Look! Look there! It is the tidal wave!”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Miss Williams. “That is not it.”
</p>

<p>
And, indeed, presently there appeared a wave
which was greater still—it reared its crest, towered
aloft, and fell.
</p>

<p>
“That was it! That was it!”
</p>

<p>
But still farther away, on the line of the horizon,
a mighty wave—a veritable wall of water—was
approaching, formidable, gigantic, fabulous....
</p>

<p>
That was the “tidal wave.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
In the course of my life, when events tragic and
inexorable have raised their threatening billows
above me and caught me in their crashing downfall,
sweeping me like a piece of frail wreckage
towards destruction, I have said to myself:
“This is the tidal wave. Nothing worse can follow.
Nothing more terrible than this can come
upon me.”
</p>

<p>
But lo! behind that great wave of calamity
another and still greater has followed, and still
another and another—fabulous waves of tragedy
and disaster.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that when I left Prilukoff that evening
I thought that the tidal wave of my destiny
had at last passed over me. Nothing more could
crush and overwhelm me; before me stretched only
the limitless levels of grief and remorse.
</p>

<p>
But it was not so. Another—the last—wave of
disaster was rearing itself like the fabulous wall
of water of my childhood's recollections, carrying
me on its crest, crashing down with me to irremediable
ruin, to the fathomless abyss of crime.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
That very night Tioka fell ill. Elise came hurriedly
into my room to call me. “Come at once,
my lady. The young master is very ill. He is
delirious and keeps talking to himself.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
I ran into the child's room. He was sitting up
in bed, his wide eyes glowing in his fevered face.
Where and when had I once before seen him like
this?...
</p>

<p>
His mind was wandering, and he talked incessantly—about
Tania whom he had not seen or
mentioned for the past two years, about his grandmother,
and the old dog Bear. Then suddenly
he asked for a picture and for some poetry.
“Mama,” he said, clinging to my neck, “say the
poetry to me, the poetry—”
</p>

<p>
“What poetry, oh, my darling, my darling?”
</p>

<p>
“The poetry about the picture. Say it. Say
it.” He began to cry and tremble with his hot
cheek close to mine.
</p>

<p>
I racked my brain for a poem:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“This is the miller who lives in the mill,</p>
<p>The mill beside the river, oh!...”</p>
</div>

<p>
“No, no, no!” cried the child. “Not that!”
</p>

<p>
I tried again:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“Brown-eyed Peter is going for a soldier;</p>
<p>Going for a soldier with his little turn-up nose...”</p>
</div>

<p>
“No, no, no!” shrieked Tioka despairingly.
“Tania, Tania—the moon—the picture. Say it
quickly!”
</p>

<p>
A lightning flash seemed to tear the clouds of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
oblivion from my brain and illuminate the past.
I was once more in Vassili's country house ...
once more I entered the dim white nursery where
my children, like two blonde seraphs, lay asleep....
A lamp hanging between the two little cots
lit up an artless picture hanging on the wall—a
rippling-haired Madonna standing in a star-lit
sky, holding in her youthful arms the infant Jesus
with a count's coronet on His head.
</p>

<p>
Crying softly as I cradled my son's fair head
upon my breast, I began:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“When little children sleep, the Virgin Mary</p>
<p>Steps with white feet upon the crescent moon....”</p>
</div>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
Tioka grew worse. With glittering eyes and
thin red cheeks he cried all day long that he
wanted Grania—that he wanted Tania. But
Grania had been sent away hurriedly for fear of
infection—Count Kamarowsky's sister had come
and taken him away—and Tania, alas! the gentle
little Tania, far away in the castle of the Tarnowskys,
had doubtless long since forgotten her
brother Tioka and her heart-broken mother as
well.
</p>

<p>
The doctors shook their heads gravely as they
stood by the tumbled cot in which the little boy
tossed and moaned ceaselessly: “A train—a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
train is running over my head. Take it away!
It hurts me, it hurts me...” And as they
looked into his throat, which was dark red, almost
purple in hue, they murmured: “Diphtheria?
Scarlet fever?” Then they went away, conversing
in low tones, leaving me beside myself with
grief and terror.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky watched with me night and day.
Sometimes he fell asleep; and when I saw him
sleeping, the old, unreasoning hatred for him
stirred in my heart again.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff had left the Hotel Victoria, and had
taken a room at the Bristol to be near us. Occasionally
I saw him for a moment standing mournful
and depressed outside my door. We looked
at each other with anguish-stricken eyes, but we
scarcely ever spoke. I had no thought for anything
but Tioka.
</p>

<p>
One night—the fourth since he had been taken
ill—the child, who had been dozing for a few moments,
awoke coughing and choking.
</p>

<p>
“Mother, mother!” he gasped, fixing his large
frightened eyes upon me. “Why do you let me
die?” Then he closed his eyes again.
</p>

<p>
I stood as if turned to stone. It was true. It
was I, I who was letting him die. That idea had
already flitted through my brain, but I had never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
dared to formulate the awful thought. As soon
as he had fallen ill I had said to myself: “This
is retribution. Did I not vow on Tioka's
life?...”
</p>

<p>
I saw myself again at the theater on the evening
of “The Merry Widow,” and Prilukoff pointing
to the child's angel head and whispering: “If
you break your word, it is he who will pay for it.”
</p>

<p>
Yes; Tioka was paying for it. He was paying
for the iniquitous vow that had been wrung from
me that night at Orel when the three men pursued
me in the darkness. With his revolver pressed
against his temple Prilukoff had bidden me:
“Swear!” Ah, why had I not let his fate overtake
him? Why had he not pulled the trigger and
fallen dead at my feet? Naumoff would have
rushed in, and Kamarowsky would have broken in
the door, and the whole of the triple treachery and
fraud and dishonor would have been revealed; but,
at least, I should have been free—free to take my
child and wander with him through the wide spaces
of the world. Whereas, coward that I had been,
the fear of disgrace had vanquished me, and the
threat of ignominy and death had dragged the inhuman
vow from my lips.... And now Tioka
was paying for it.
</p>

<p>
The fierce primitive instinct of maternity awoke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
within me. Weakened by illness and wakefulness,
my spirit lost itself again in the dark labyrinth of
superstition. My frantic gaze passed from Tioka—lying
wan and wasted on his pillows, gasping
like a little dying bird—to Kamarowsky stretched
out in an armchair, with his flaccid hands hanging
at his sides and the corners of his mouth relaxed in
sleep. I looked at him; I seemed to see him for
the first time—this man to save whose life I was
sacrificing my own child's. Yes, Tioka was dying
in order that this stranger, this outsider, this
enemy might live.
</p>

<p>
When I turned towards Tioka again I saw that
his eyes were open and fixed upon me. I fell on
my knees beside him and whispered wildly:
“Darling, darling, I will not let you die. No, my
soul, my own, I will save you. You shall get well
again and run out and play in the sunshine....
The other one shall die—but not you, not you!
Now you will get well immediately. Are you not
better already, my love, my own? Are you not
better already?”
</p>

<p>
And my boy, cradled in my arms, smiled faintly
as my soft wild whispers lulled him to sleep.
</p>

<p>
This idea now took possession of my brain,
to the exclusion of all others. I thought and
dreamed of nothing else. Tioka had scarlet fever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
and the fluctuations in his illness seemed to depend
solely upon me. When I told myself that
I was firmly, irrevocably resolved to compass the
death of Kamarowsky, the child's fever seemed to
abate, his throat was less inflamed, the pains in his
head diminished. But if, as I grew calmer and
clung to hope again, I hesitated in my ruthless
purpose, lo! the fever seized him anew, the rushing
trains went thundering over his temples, and
his tender throat swelled until he could hardly
draw his breath.
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff followed the oscillations of my distracted
spirit with weary resignation; he was benumbed
and apathetic, without mind and without
will. When in the fixity of my mania I insisted
upon the necessity of the crime, he would answer
languidly: “Oh, no. Leave it alone. Let things
be.”
</p>

<p>
Then I grew more and more frenzied, weeping
and tearing my hair.
</p>

<p>
“Can you not understand that Tioka is dying?
Tioka, my little Tioka is dying! And it is we who
are killing him.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no,” sighed Prilukoff. “Let things
alone.”
</p>

<p>
Tioka grew worse.
</p>

<p>
A day came when he could not see me or hear
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
me—when he lay quite still with scarcely flickering
breath. Then I rose as one in a dream. I went
to Prilukoff's room.
</p>

<p>
He sat listlessly by the window, smoking. I
seized him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
“Donat Prilukoff, I renew my oath. Paul
Kamarowsky shall die within this year!”
</p>

<p>
“All right, all right!” grumbled Prilukoff,
wearied to exhaustion by my constant changes of
mood. “Let us finish him once for all, and have
done with it.”
</p>

<p>
I gasped. “Where? When? Is it <i>you</i> who
will—”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff raised his long, languid eyes. “Whatever
you like,” he said. Then he added in a spent
voice: “I am very tired.”
</p>

<p>
And it was I who urged him, who pushed him
on, who hurried him to think out and shape our
plans. He was languid and inert. Sometimes he
would look dully at me and say: “What a terrible
woman you are.” But I thought only of
Tioka, and my eager and murderous frenzy increased.
</p>

<p>
And behold! Tioka got better. This chance
coincidence assumed in my diseased brain the
character of a direct answer from heaven. The
sacrifice had been accepted!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
A year later, when I stood before the judges
who were to sentence me, no word of this delusion
passed my lips. Demented though I was, I knew
myself to be demented; I knew that this idea of a
barter with heaven was an insensate idea; and
yet, by some fallacy of my hallucinated brain, I
believed—do I not even now believe it?—that my
vow had been heard, that my word must be kept,
that one life must be bought with the other.
</p>

<p>
Even so, better, far better would it have been to
let my child's white soul flutter heavenwards, than
to retain it with my blood-stained hand.
</p>

<p>
But at that time my one thought was to save
him, even though for his life, not one, but a thousand
others had been immolated.
</p>

<p>
The day came when I was able to carry him in
my arms from his cot to an easy chair beside the
window. What a joy was that brief transit! His
frail arms were round my neck and his head lay
on my shoulder. With slow, lingering steps I
went, loth to leave him out of my embrace.
</p>

<p>
A sweet Italian verse came light and fragrant
into my memory:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>I thought I bore a flower within my arms...</p>
</div>

<p>
It was Prilukoff who reminded me with a cynical
smile that the vow included also Nicolas Naumoff.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Nicolas Naumoff! I had almost forgotten him.
Nicolas Naumoff! Must he, this distant and forgotten
stranger, also die?
</p>

<p>
I cannot tell which of us it was who conceived
the idea of making use of him as our instrument—of
destroying him by making him a weapon of
destruction, of murdering him by making him a
murderer.
</p>

<p>
The idea may have been mine. I feared that
I could not rely upon the languid, listless Prilukoff.
Yes; it must have been I who devised this method
of propitiating the avenging Fates, and averting
from us the imminent Nemesis.
</p>

<p>
“A good idea,” said Prilukoff wearily. “Let
Naumoff do it.” And he lighted a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
I gazed at him, aquiver with superstitious dread.
“Do you think that then Naumoff need not die?
Do you think that”—I hesitated—“<i>that</i> will be
enough?...”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff turned and looked at me as if aghast.
Then he nodded his head and the fearful, crooked
smile distorted his countenance.
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” he said. “I think that will be enough.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>

</p>

<h2>
XXXVIII
</h2>

<p>
To what end should I narrate anew the terrible
story which is known to all? Must I dip again
into the soilure and abomination of that awful
time? How dare I tell of the luring telegrams
sent to the distant Naumoff, my guileless and impassioned
lover, and of the joy and gratitude with
which he hastened to me? How describe the slow,
insidious poisoning of his mind against Kamarowsky,
the hatred subtly instilled in him against
that unconscious, kindly man? And the lies, the
slanders, the ambiguous disclosures of pretended
outrages inflicted upon me, of insults and injuries
I feigned to have suffered at Kamarowsky's
hands?...
</p>

<p>
Naumoff believed it all. His astonishment and
indignation knew no bounds. What? Kamarowsky,
whom he had always thought the most
chivalrous and considerate of men, was a despicable,
worthless coward? Well, Naumoff would
challenge him; he would fight a duel to the death
with him who had been his best friend.
</p>

<p>
But not that, not that was what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
Tioka recovered. Taller, thinner and paler, he
came out once more into the sunshine, leaning
on my arm, enraptured at everything, greeting
every ray of light and every winged or
flowering thing as if it were a new acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
Not for an instant did I suffer my mind to
waver. God, the terrible God of my disordered
fancy, had accepted the compact, and it was now
for me to carry it out.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Tioka was well enough to travel, I
sent him to Russia to some of our relations.
While I was discharging my debt for his life, he
must be far away.
</p>

<p>
Then began the ghastly game, the sinister
comedy with the three puppets, whose strings I
held in my fragile hands. I had to tranquilize
and disarm Kamarowsky; to kindle and fan the
murderous fury of Prilukoff; and above all to enchain
and infatuate Naumoff, so as to impel him
to the crime.
</p>

<p>
Ah, every art that Lilith, daughter of Eve and
of the Serpent, has bequeathed to woman, every
insidious perversity and subtle wile did I bring
into play to charm and enamor this youthful
dreamer. With every incitement did I lure and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
tempt him; with every witchery did I entangle
him in the meshes of my perversity and in the
whirlwind of my golden hair.
</p>

<p>
I was indeed the modern Circe, weaving her
evil spell. I was fervent and temerarious, full of
exotic anomalies, eccentric, unexpected.... I delighted
in causing him both pleasure and suffering
in a thousand unnatural and outrageous ways; I
cut my initials in his arm with the triangular blade
of a dagger; I pressed my lighted cigarette upon
his hand; I assumed all the absurdities, perversities
and puerilities with which since time immemorial
woman has decoyed and beguiled man,
who, after all, is essentially a simple-minded and
ingenuous being.
</p>

<p>
Nicolas Naumoff was dazed and fascinated by
all this strange hysteria and subtlety. He believed
himself to be the hero of a fabulous passion—the
incomparable conqueror of a wondrous and
portentous love.
</p>

<p>
There were times when I myself was carried
away by this play of my own invention. Now and
then I lost sight of the grim purpose of this process
of seduction; I rejoiced in my own coquetries,
and myself burned in the flame I had deliberately
kindled.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
One evening as he knelt before me, pressing my
cool hands against his fevered forehead, I bent
over him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
“Why do you love me so much?” I asked.
“Tell me. Tell me the truth.”
</p>

<p>
He answered me gravely in a deep voice,
enumerating the reasons on my fingers as he held
them in his own.
</p>

<p>
“I love you because you are beautiful and terrible.
Because you have that white, subtle face,
and that mouth that is like a greedy rose, and
those long, cruel eyes ... I love you because you
are different from all others, better or worse than
all, more intelligent and more passionate than all.”
He was silent for a moment. “And also because
you have forced me to love you.”
</p>

<p>
Yes. I had forced him to love me. And now
he was what I wanted him to be—an instrument
ready to my hand: a fierce and docile instrument
of death, a submissive and murderous weapon.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
June crept warmly up from the south, and murmured
of blue waters and dancing sunlight.
</p>

<p>
“Mura, let us go to Venice,” said Paul Kamarowsky
one afternoon as he sat beside me on the
balcony; “let us pass these last three months of
waiting at the Lido. If needs be, I can take you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
back to Russia later on, to complete the few formalities
that must precede our marriage.”
</p>

<p>
“To Venice?” I said faintly.
</p>

<p>
Paul Kamarowsky smiled.
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>“<i>Ti guardo e palpito, Venezia mia,</i>“</p>
</div>

<p>
he quoted under his breath. And bending forward,
he kissed my trembling lips.

XXXIX
</h2>

<p>
We prepared to leave. Naumoff's despair was
puerile and clamorous. I entreated him to go
back to Orel and wait for me there, and I promised
him that I would soon return to Russia and see
him again. As for Prilukoff, he awakened from
his lethargy with the roar of a wounded wild beast.
“To Venice! You are going to Venice with that
man? Is that how you keep your vow?”
</p>

<p>
“I will keep it, I will keep it,” I cried. “But
I said—it—it should be done within the year—this
is only June—we can wait six months longer.”
</p>

<p>
“By that time you will be his wife,” snarled
Prilukoff between clenched teeth. “Unless it is
done within the next three months you know it
will never be done at all. Go your way,” he
jeered, “do as you like! Play fast and loose with
fate as you have played fast and loose with me!”
He turned and gripped my wrist. “But you will
escape neither of us. Fate and I will overtake
you, Marie Tarnowska, be it in Venice—or in
hell!”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
We left for the Lido.
</p>

<p>
And while, on the arm of my bethrothed, I
wandered by the dancing waters, and the golden
hours showered their light upon us, in my dark
heart I prayed:
</p>

<p>
“God, give me strength and ruthlessness! God,
who didst guide the hand of Judith, fill my soul
with violence and teach my hand to slay!”
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
Prilukoff followed us to Verona. Then he came
after us to Venice, where he took rooms in the
same hotel, lurking in the corridors, shadowing us
in the streets, pursuing me day and night with
his misery and jealousy. Occasionally I saw him
for a few moments alone, and then we would
whisper together about the deed that was to be
done, speaking feverishly in low quick tones like
demented creatures. If I wavered, it was he who
reminded me ruthlessly of my child and of my
vow; if he hesitated, it was I who with the insensate
perversity of madness urged him on towards
the crime.
</p>

<p>
One evening—ah, how well do I remember that
radiant summer sunset beneath which the lagoon
lay like a fluid sheet of copper!—he met me on
the Lido. He was morose and gloomy. He took
from his pocket a black crumpled package. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Elise's old satchel—the “white elephant,” tattered,
empty, dead.
</p>

<p>
With a vehement movement he flung it into the
water. Where it fell the sheet of copper shivered
into a thousand splinters of red gold.
</p>

<p>
“Empty?” I asked in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
“Empty,” he replied.
</p>

<p>
“And now, what will you do?”
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders. It was then that
the idea came to him—the execrable, the nefarious
idea.
</p>

<p>
“Listen. As he”—with a movement of his
head he indicated the absent Kamarowsky—“is
doomed—I suppose he is doomed, isn't he?” he
interposed.
</p>

<p>
I assented in a barely audible whisper: “Yes.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, his—his disappearance may as well be
of some use. Do you not think so?”
</p>

<p>
Seeing the look of horror which I turned upon
him, he continued: “For goodness' sake don't
let us behave like romantic fools. We are not a
pair of poetic assassins in a play, are we?”
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f268"></a>
  <img src="images/268.jpg"
  alt="" />
<p class="caption">UNDER ARREST</p>
</div>

<p>
Gradually, by subtle pleading and plausible
argument, he led my weak brain to view the idea
with less horror. He assured me that we had not
only the right but almost the duty to commit this
enormity. According to him, it was not a shameful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
and disgraceful deed. No; it was a just,
reasonable, logical thing to do.
</p>

<p>
“Of course, it is not as if we were getting rid
of a man simply in order to plunder him of his
money. No, indeed. That would be vile, that
would be abominable. But, given the necessity—the
irrevocableness—of his fate, why should
we not see to it that his death may at least be
of some use to some one? Not to ourselves, remember.
The money you get from him shall be
used to serve a just purpose—to redress a wrong.
We shall make restitution to those I have despoiled.
I will pay back what I took from my
clients to the very last farthing. And anything
that is left over shall be given in charity to the
poor. What do you say to that? We shall keep
nothing for ourselves—nothing. Do you agree?”
</p>

<p>
He went on to recall that among the clients he
had defrauded was a widow with four little children;
the thought of her, he said, had always
worried him. It was good to think that she
would recover every penny.
</p>

<p>
The advocate in him awoke, eloquent and convincing,
until he ended by assuring me that we
should be performing a meritorious deed.
</p>

<p>
Indignant at first, then uncertain, then reluctant,
I was finally persuaded. Soon I heard myself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
repeating after him: “It will be a meritorious
deed.”
</p>

<p>
Ah, if such beings as evil spirits exist, with what
laughter must they have listened to our talk in that
exquisite evening hour.
</p>

<p>
It was Prilukoff who thought out the details and
settled the plan.
</p>

<p>
“You must get him to insure his life.”
</p>

<p>
“How can I?” I cried feebly and tearfully.
“How can one possibly suggest such a thing?”
</p>

<p>
“Leave that to me,” said Prilukoff, reverting
to his Moscow manner.
</p>

<p>
Next day he showed me a letter written by himself
in a disguised hand.
</p>

<p>
“Open this letter when he is present, and when
he insists on seeing it, show it to him ... reluctantly!”
</p>

<p>
“But what if he does not insist?”
</p>

<p>
“You must make him insist,” said Prilukoff.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
The letter was brought to me in Kamarowsky's
presence, and when he saw me turning scarlet and
then pale as I opened it, he insisted on seeing what
it contained.
</p>

<p>
I showed it to him ... reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
The letter was in Prilukoff's handwriting, but
was signed “Ivan Troubetzkoi.” The prince
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
(whom I scarcely remembered, and whom I had
not seen for more than six years) begged me to
marry him, and as proof of his devotion offered
to make a will in my favor and, in addition, to
insure his life for half a million francs.
</p>

<p>
Paul Kamarowsky was aghast.
</p>

<p>
“Is everybody trying to steal you away from
me, Mura?” he exclaimed brokenly; then he sat
down on the sofa with his head in his hands. I
gazed at him, feeling as if I should die with sorrow
and remorse.
</p>

<p>
For a long time he did not speak. Then he
drew me to him.
</p>

<p>
“Dear one, do not heed the offers of other
people. No one, whether he be prince or moujik,
can love you more than I do. No one will do
more for you than I am willing to do. I, also, am
ready to make a will in your favor; I, also, will
insure my life for half a million francs.”
</p>

<p>
“No, no,” I cried, crushed with misery and
shame.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes, I will. It shall be done immediately.
To-day.”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
And it was done.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
“You see?” cried Prilukoff triumphantly, “I
am not quite a fool yet, am I? Hush now, don't
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
cry. Remember that it is not for ourselves, but
to make an honorable act of restitution.”
</p>

<p>
“But a hundred thousand francs would have
been enough for that,” I sobbed.
</p>

<p>
“The other four hundred thousand we shall give
to the poor,” said Prilukoff. “It will be a meritorious
deed.”

<h2>
XL
</h2>

<p>
I remember that when I was a child I was taken
to a fair and given a ride on a switchback railway.
I was scarcely seated in the car, with the straps
round my waist and the giddy track before me,
than I cried to get out again. But the car was
already moving forward, slowly gliding down the
first incline.
</p>

<p>
I screamed, writhing against the straps, “Stop!
stop! I want to get out. I want to go back!”
But now the car was rushing giddily, in leaps and
bounds, down one slope and up another, whirling
over bridges and gulfs, dashing down the precipitous
declivity with ever-increasing speed.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Even thus had I embarked, almost without
realizing it, upon the rapid slope of crime. Impelled
by my own madness, I had started on the
vertiginous course to perdition, and now I plunged
downwards, rolling, leaping, rushing into the darkness,
without possibility of pause or return.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
It was Kamarowsky himself who begged me
to leave Venice for Kieff, where some formalities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
still remained to be accomplished before our impending
marriage. He offered to accompany me,
but I declined. He resigned himself, therefore,
though with reluctance, to allowing me to start
alone with Elise.
</p>

<p>
“Now,” said Prilukoff, on the eve of my departure—and
the transversal vein stood out like
whipcord on his forehead—“let there be no more
backing out and putting off. You will see Naumoff
in Russia; send him straight back here. I'm
sick of this business; let us get it over.”
</p>

<p>
I bowed my head and wept.
</p>

<p>
Kamarowsky took me to the railway station,
where I found the compartment he had reserved
for me already filled with flowers. I thanked him
with trembling lips.
</p>

<p>
“In three weeks, my love,” he said, “you will
be back again, and then I shall not part from you
any more.” He kissed me and stepped down upon
the platform, where he stood gazing up at me with
smiling eyes. Many people stood near, watching
us. I leaned out of the carriage window, and
as I looked at him I kept repeating to myself:
“This is the last time I shall see him! The last
time!”
</p>

<p>
It seemed strange and incongruous to see him
there, with his usual aspect, making ordinary gestures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
and uttering commonplace remarks. Knowing
as I did that he stood on the threshold of death,
I wondered that he had not a more staid and
solemn demeanor, slower, graver gestures and
memorable words.
</p>

<p>
Whereas he was saying, with a smile: “Mind
you don't lose your purse; and remember to look
after your luggage at the Customs. You will have
the dining-car at Bozen.” And then, looking
about him: “Would you like some newspapers?”
He hurried away after the newsvendor, and then
counted his change and argued about a coin which
he thought was counterfeit. He came back to my
carriage door, handed me the newspapers, and
with his handkerchief dried his forehead and the
inside of his hat.
</p>

<p>
“Fearfully hot,” he said, looking up at me with
a friendly laugh.
</p>

<p>
All this seemed terribly out of keeping with the
tragic situation of which, all unconsciously, he was
the hero. I tried to say something tender and
affectionate to him, but my agitation stifled me.
</p>

<p>
“Mind you are good,” he said, still smiling, and
he threw a glance at some officers in the compartment
next to mine.
</p>

<p>
I heard the doors being shut and the guard calling
out “<i>Partenza!</i>” My heart began to beat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
wildly. I felt as if once again I were strapped
in the car on the switchback railway. I wanted
to get out, to stop, to turn back. A whistle
sounded and a gong was struck.
</p>

<p>
“Well, Mura, <i>au revoir</i>,” cried Kamarowsky,
stretching up his hand to me. “A happy journey
and all blessings.”
</p>

<p>
I leaned out as far as I could—the bar across
the window hindered me, but I managed to touch
his outstretched hand with the tips of my fingers.
</p>

<p>
A spasm caught my throat. “Paul, Paul!” I
gasped. “Oh, God, forgive me!” A shrill
whistle drowned my voice as the train moved
slowly forward.
</p>

<p>
He must have seen the anguish in my face, for
he cried anxiously:
</p>

<p>
“What? What did you say?” Now he was
running beside the train, which was beginning to
go faster.
</p>

<p>
I repeated my cry: “Forgive me! Forgive
me!” and stretched out my arms to him from the
window.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head to show that he had not understood.
The train was throbbing and hastening.
</p>

<p>
He ran faster beside it. “What—what is it?
What did you say?” But the train was gaining
speed, and he was obliged to stop. He stood there,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
erect and solitary, at the extreme end of the platform,
following with perplexed and questioning
gaze the train that was carrying me away.
</p>

<p>
It is thus always that I see him in my memory—a
solitary figure, gazing at me with perplexed
and wondering eyes.
</p>

<p>
Surely it is thus, thus wondering and perplexed,
that he must have looked in the face of death and
treachery, on that summer morning when he was
struck down by the hand of his friend.
</p>

<p>
The switchback plunges downward in its mad
race to the abyss—the end is near.
</p>

<p>
At Kieff, as arranged, I meet Naumoff.
</p>

<p>
I sob out my despair to him. Paul Kamarowsky
must die. I give no reason, I explain nothing;
I repeat unceasingly the three words: “He
must die,” until there seem to be no other words
in the world—until the universe seems to ring
with those three words: “He must die!”
</p>

<p>
Naumoff recoils from me, pale-faced and horrified.
Then I drive him from me, crying: “Go,
you are a coward. Let me never see you
again!”
</p>

<p>
“But why should he die?” cries Naumoff.
“What has the poor man done to you?”
</p>

<p>
Ah, what, indeed, has the poor man done?
</p>

<p>
Ramblingly, incoherently, I try to explain to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
Naumoff; I tell him of Tioka and his illness, of
my vow.... He listens amazed, without comprehending.
</p>

<p>
“But Mura, Mura! This is delirium, this is
madness. You are ill, you are out of your mind.
How can such an insensate idea possess you?
How can you imagine that God would demand such
an iniquity?”
</p>

<p>
Then I rack my brain for arguments that will
convince him. I invent all manner of falsehoods;
I repeat the tale of insults and outrages that I have
endured at the hands of Kamarowsky; I accuse
him of violence and brutality ... and even as I
tell these mad stories they seem to myself to be
true. I am thrilled by my own words; I tremble,
I weep convulsively; and Naumoff, ever more pale,
ever more bewildered, does not know what to believe.
</p>

<p>
Continually, a dozen times a day, blind to all
caution, reckless of all consequences, I send telegrams
to Prilukoff—the telegrams that afterwards
were found, and led to our arrest—“Berta refuses.”
(Prilukoff, I know not for what reason,
had nicknamed Naumoff “Berta.”) Then again:
“Berta will do it.” And again: “Berta irresolute.
What am I to do?”
</p>

<p>
Then seized by sudden panic: “Wait! Do no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
harm to any one. Advise me. Help me. I am
going mad.”
</p>

<p>
Prilukoff telegraphs back his usual set phrase:
“Leave it to me.” And he forthwith proceeds to
send me a number of telegrams, all of which contain
a series of insults and taunts addressed both
to Naumoff and to myself. He signs them “Paul
Kamarowsky.” Naumoff reads them in amazement,
then in anger; finally he, too, becomes possessed
of the idea of crime, obsessed by the frenzy
of murder.
</p>

<p>
How can I tell the terrible story further?...
The gust of madness caught us in its whirlwind,
dashing us round like leaves blown in a storm.
</p>

<p>
One evening—it was a pale, clear twilight at the
close of August—I sprang suddenly to my feet,
and winding a black veil round my hair, I ran from
my rooms and down the wide shallow flights of the
hotel staircase. There were large mirrors on
every landing. As I descended I saw at every
turn a woman coming to meet me, a tall, spectral
creature with a black veil tied round a white, desolate
face ... her light, wild eyes filled me with
fear, and I hurried forward to reach the hall,
where I heard voices and music.
</p>

<p>
Standing beside the piano in the vast lounge,
two young girls were singing; they were English
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
girls, and they sang, with shy, cool voices, a duet
of Mendelssohn:
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f280"></a>

<p class="caption">Fair Springtime bids the bluebells ring Sweet chimes o'er vale and lea</p>
<div class="listen-music">
[<a href="music/music_1.mid">Listen</a>]
</div>
</div>

<p>
Some distance away, listening to them with
tranquil contentment on their peaceful faces,
sat their parents—the father, a stern, stately old
man with kindly eyes; the mother, gentle and
serene, wearing the white lace cap of renunciation
on her smooth gray hair. As I passed them with
faltering step the mother turned and looked at me.
What did she read in my face that wakened such
a look of tenderness and pity in hers?... She
smiled at me, and that smile seemed to stop my
heart, so guileless was it, so maternal and so kind.
</p>

<p>
For an instant a wild thought possessed me: to
stop, to fall upon my knees before this gentle, unknown
woman and implore her help.
</p>

<p>
What if I cried out to her: “Help me, have
pity upon me! I am an unhappy creature whom
the Fates pursue.... I am distraught, I am demented—to-morrow
I shall have murder on my
soul. Keep me near you ... save me! Unless
you help me I am lost....”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
But the Furies that pursued me laughed aloud
and lashed me forward.
</p>

<p>
And now Nicolas Naumoff, who had noticed my
flight, came running down the staircase to follow
me....
</p>

<p>
I crossed the hall rapidly and went out into the
dusk.
</p>

<h2>
XLI
</h2>

<p>
Through the twilight streets I hastened, and
Naumoff followed, calling me by my name; but I
did not answer him. Through the long Road of
the Cross I hurried silently, and out through the
Golden Gate, and on, down dusty solitary streets,
past the Church of All Saints, until at last I stood
before the cemetery where my mother is laid to
rest.
</p>

<p>
“Where are we going?” asked Naumoff.
“Why have you come here?”
</p>

<p>
But without answering him I threw a ruble to
the gatekeeper and entered the silent pathways of
the churchyard.
</p>

<p>
The sky was still light in the west, but the paths
were gloomy in the shadow of willow and cypress
trees. Hastening on between the double rows of
flower-decked graves, and the monuments that
gleamed whitely in the twilight, I reached my
mother's tomb. I knelt and kissed the great
marble cross that stands so heavily above her frail
brow. And the thought of her lying there, so desolate
and alone, abandoned to the rains and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
winds and the darkness of long dreadful nights,
struck terror to my heart.
</p>

<p>
“Speak to me, mother,” I whispered to her.
“Tell me what I am to do. You who know all—all
about the vow and little Tioka, and the terrible
things that are in my life—tell me, mother,
must Paul Kamarowsky die?”
</p>

<p>
My mother did not answer.
</p>

<p>
“Tell me, tell me, mother! Is he to die?” My
mother was silent. But the evening breeze passed
over the delicate flowers, the lilies and campanulas
which cover her grave; and they all nodded their
heads, saying: “Yes, yes, yes.”
</p>

<p>
“Did you see?” I whispered to Naumoff.
</p>

<p>
But he only looked at me with bewildered eyes.
And I drew him away. “We must go quickly,”
I said.
</p>

<p>
Now it was growing dark. I hastened along the
winding narrow pathways until in a deserted corner
I found what I was seeking: a neglected grave
marked by a gray stone bearing a name and a date.
</p>

<p>
As I gazed at that mound of earth, on which a
long-since withered wreath spoke of forgetfulness,
a wave of desolation swept over my heart. How
sad and empty and useless was everything! Life
and hope and love and desire—all empty, all unavailing....
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
“Who is buried here?” asked Naumoff under
his breath. He bent forward and read the name
aloud: “<i>Vladimir Stahl.</i>”
</p>

<p>
Something stirred. Perhaps it was only the dry
leaves of the withered wreath, but I was afraid—afraid
that I should see Stahl suddenly move
and rise up, covered with mold, to answer to his
name.
</p>

<p>
“Vladimir Stahl...” whispered Naumoff
again, raising his haggard boyish face and gazing
at me, “Mura, Mura, I see you encompassed by the
dead.”
</p>

<p>
Doubtless he meant the tombs which spread
around me in a livid semicircle; but to me it seemed
that he could discern standing behind me all my
dead—my mother and Stahl, and Bozevsky and
little Peter.... I uttered a scream as I looked
fearfully behind me.
</p>

<p>
“Why do you scream?” gasped Naumoff; and
he also turned and looked round. Then he pointed
to the grave in front of us. “Who was this?”
he asked in a low voice. “Did he love you?”
His eyes flickered strangely. There was horror
and lust and frenzy in the gaze he fixed upon
me.
</p>

<p>
I was silent.
</p>

<p>
“Did he love you? Did he love you?” He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
pressed closer to me, with parted lips and quickening
breath.
</p>

<p>
Then I bent towards him, and a thrill such as I
have never felt passed through me. “Swear—on
the dead—that you will kill that man.”
</p>

<p>
“I swear it,” he gasped. “Terrible woman that
you are, I swear it.”
</p>

<p>
“Go,” I whispered. “Go ... at once.” But
he sprang towards me and fastened his lips upon
mine.
</p>

<p>
Amid all the horrors that haunt my memory,
all the spectral visions which drift darkly through
the labyrinth of my life, that frenzied embrace
among the tombs in the crepuscular cemetery, still
rises before me—a ghost of darkness and of shame.
</p>

<p>
He turned and left me. I heard his footsteps
running along the gravel path, I saw his tall
shadowy figure vanish in the gloom.... He was
gone.
</p>

<p>
I was alone in the nocturnal churchyard, alone
by Stahl's desolate grave.
</p>

<p>
“Nicolas Naumoff!” I cried. But no one answered
me, and fear ran into my heart with thudding
steps.
</p>

<p>
I hurried forward, down the narrow path
bordered with tombs and turned to the right,
down another wider avenue among other endless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
rows of the dead.... Where was I? In which
direction lay the gate?... I turned and ran
back. I must find Stahl's grave again, and then
go to the left through the unconsecrated burial-ground
of those who had died by their own hand....
With shuddering breath I stumbled forward,
but nowhere could I find the dreary field of the
unshriven dead. Tall sepulchers and mausoleums
loomed dimly on either side of me, limitless rows
of tombstones and statues ... but Stahl's low,
dreary mound was nowhere to be seen. Stay—behind
the willows on the right, was that not the
white cross standing on my mother's grave?...
To reach it quickly I left the pathway and ran
diagonally across the burial ground trampling the
graves in my haste to reach that large cross shimmering
in the gloom.... No, it was not my
mother's grave. But further on, and further,
other crosses glimmered and beckoned—and I ran
on, crazed and terror-stricken, stumbling over
mounds and hillocks, tripping in iron railings,
trampling over flowers and wreaths ... until I
fell in the darkness and lay unconscious and silent
amid the silent and unconscious dead.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
A breath of soft morning air awoke me. I
opened my eyes. Elise was bending over me with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
pale and anxious face. The room—my bedroom—whirled
and swam before my dizzy sight.
</p>

<p>
“Elise!”...
</p>

<p>
Elise Perrier clasped her hands. “Thank
God!” she murmured. “I feared you would
never wake again.” Her face worked strangely,
and she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
“Elise—what has happened? What is to-day?”
Before she could answer, another question sprang
to my lips: “Where is Naumoff?”
</p>

<p>
“He has left, my lady,” whispered Elise in
awestruck tones.
</p>

<p>
“Left?” A long silence held us. “Left?
Where has he gone?”
</p>

<p>
Elise looked down at me with blanched and
quivering countenance.
</p>

<p>
“To Venice,” she said in low tones.
</p>

<p>
I started up. “To Venice?” To Venice! My
memory darted to and fro like a child playing hide
and seek. “Elise! Elise! Elise!” I stretched
out my hands like one sinking and drowning in the
darkness. Elise wept. I watched the strange
faces that Elise always made when she wept:
funny, pitiful grimaces with puckered brow and
chin.
</p>

<p>
“To Venice.” My memory flickers like a feeble
light, then blazes into sudden flames that sear my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
soul with fire. “Elise! He must be stopped. He
must not reach Venice! Elise, stop him, stop
him—!”
</p>

<p>
“It is impossible, my lady.”
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is impossible.

<p>
(<i>By this time the train which is carrying Naumoff
on his mission of death has passed Warsaw

hastening through the dawning hours and the
noonday sunshine, hastening on into the twilight—and
at dusk it rumbles and pants into the station
at Vienna</i>.)
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
I fall fainting back upon my pillows, and all
through the day and the night I dream that I am
speeding after the rushing train, catching up with
it and losing it again, sweeping through the air,
tearing along the unending rails, reaching it at
last, and being struck down and crushed under its
rolling wheels.
</p>

<p>
Day dawns once more.
</p>

<p>
“Elise, Elise, bring Naumoff back. Telegraph
to him. Elise, for heaven's sake, bring him
back!”
</p>

<p>
“It is hopeless, my lady.”
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is hopeless.

<p>
(<i>At this hour the train is hurrying from Bozen
to Verona, from Verona to Vicenza, from Vicenza
to Padua.</i>)
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Night falls on my despair.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
“Elise, Elise! Where are you? What is the
time?”
</p>

<p>
“It is nearly dawn, my lady.”
</p>

<p>
“Elise, what day is this?”
</p>

<p>
“It is the third day of September.”
</p>

<p>
The third day of September!
</p>

<p>
“Elise,” I scream suddenly, “Elise! Telegraph
to Kamarowsky. Warn him.... Quickly,
oh, quickly! Why, why did we not do so before?”
</p>

<p>
“Hush, my lady, hush! You were delirious;
you could only rave and weep.”
</p>

<p>
“Elise, Elise, telegraph to Kamarowsky....”
</p>

<p>
“It is too late, my lady.”
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is too late.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
(<i>At this very hour of dawn the train has reached
Venice. Nicolas Naumoff is hastening from the
Riva degli Schiavoni, across the empty piazza
and the deserted streets. He hails a gondola.
“Campo Santa Maria del Giglio!”</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>And the gondola, with soft plash of oar, glides
slowly towards the doomed sleeper.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
<i>What dreams may the angel of rest have sent to
him for the last time? Perhaps the tender vision
of little Grania has gladdened him, while silent and
inexorable in the closed gondola the youth with the
golden eyes steals towards him through the mazes
of the clear canals.</i>
</p>

<p>
“<i>Santa Maria del Giglio.</i>”
</p>

<p>
<i>Nicolas Naumoff springs from the gondola,
crosses the empty Campo and reaches the house.
He ascends the steps quickly, knocks, enters—and
closes the door behind him.</i>)
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Yes, it is too late.
</p>

<p>
I hear myself shrieking with laughter as I fall
back on my pillows. Soon I am surrounded by
strangers who hold me down, who thrust opiates
between my lips, who lay soothing hands and cooling
compresses on my brow. Then I know nothing
more.
</p>

<p class="dots">········</p>

<p>
Elise Perrier's terrified face surges out of the
darkness: she is speaking quickly, she is bending
over me, imploring and urging.... What does
she say? She weeps despairingly, and ever
through her tears she speaks, urging and imploring.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in her thin arms, she drags me from my
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
bed; she dresses me; she wraps a cloak about me,
and hurries backwards and forwards with traveling-bags
and satchels. Now we are in a carriage—no,
we are in a train. Elise Perrier sits opposite
me, with ashen face and her hands in gray
cotton gloves tightly folded. Her lips move. She
is praying.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly I struggle to my feet: “<i>Paul!</i>...”
</p>

<p>
As I scream the name Elise springs upon me,
covering my mouth with her cotton glove, pressing
my head to her breast. “Silence! hush, hush,
for the love of heaven! They will hear you.
Hush!”
</p>

<p>
“Is he dead, Elise, is he dead?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no, he is not dead,” gasps Elise in a toneless
whisper, “he is not dead. We are going to
him. He is wounded ... he has been telegraphing
to you for three days, begging you to come.
And you would not move, you would not understand....”
Elise is crying again.
</p>

<p>
But perfect peace has descended into my soul.
Paul is not dead. He lives! he lives! Nothing
else matters but this—he lives.
</p>

<p>
The train still rushes along, beating rhythmic
time to many tunes that are in my head; I gaze
out of the window, at the whirling landscape that
swings past like a giant chess-board, at the telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
wires that dip, and then ascend slowly and
dip again. Hours pass or days pass.... And
the train stops.
</p>

<p>
Elise is hurriedly collecting cloaks and satchels.
</p>

<p>
“Where are we, Elise? Are we in Venice?”
</p>

<p>
“Not yet; not yet. We are in Vienna.”
</p>

<p>
As I step from the train, two men whom I do
not know approach me. One of them asks me if
I am the Countess Tarnowska. He has not taken
his hat off, and I do not deign to reply.
</p>

<p>
As I am about to pass him he lays his hand on
my arm. The other man also comes forward, and,
one on each side, they conduct me along the platform.
I notice many people stopping to look at
me.
</p>

<p>
Nothing seems to matter. I do not remember
why we are in Vienna, nor whither we are bound.
I notice that it is a bright, hot day, and I feel that
I am walking in a dream.... I find myself thinking
of Vassili; I wish he would come, and send
these men away and take me home. I shall be
glad when I am at home with Vassili and the children
and Aunt Sonia.... Safely at home!
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="f292"></a>
  <img src="images/292.jpg"
  alt="" />
<p class="caption">IN THE PRISON CELL</p>
</div>

<p>
Then I remember—I have no home. I am a forsaken,
demented creature whom Vassili cares for
no longer. But where am I going? I am going
to Paul Kamarowsky, who lives and loves me!...
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
Again I weep with joy and thankfulness at the
thought that Kamarowsky lives.
</p>

<p>
Now I am in a carriage driving through the
streets of Vienna; and the two strange men are
still with me. They are taking me to a hotel.
We arrive. I pass through a large doorway and
along some passages. Then I notice that it is not
a hotel. It is a vast, bare room with wooden
benches round the wall. Some men in uniform
stand at the door, and I notice that they do not
salute me when I enter.
</p>

<p>
Neither does an elderly man who is sitting at
the desk rise or come to meet me. He looks at
me steadily and asks me many questions; but I
pay no heed to him. The windows are open; I can
hear the sound of a piano very far away; somebody
is practising a romance by Chaminade that I
used to play at Otrada.... How sad a piano
sounds when played by an unseen hand in the
silence of a sunlit street!
</p>

<p>
The man at the desk speaks in German to the
uniformed men; they take my golden wristbag
from me, and conduct me out of the bare room
down a long passage. As I go slowly forward
between the two men I notice that from the far
end of the passage a group of people are coming
towards us. In the center of the group walks a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
man, handcuffed and wearing his hat crookedly at
the back of his head, as if placed there by some
other hand than his own. <i>It is Prilukoff!</i>
</p>

<p>
He sees me. A wave of livid pallor overspreads
his face. Then he bends forward towards me and
makes a movement with his lips, pressing them
tightly together and shaking his head; he is trying
to make me understand something. As they
notice this the men at my side grasp my arm and
make me turn quickly down another corridor. But
I hear Prilukoff's voice shouting after me. He
utters a Russian word: “Molci!” (Be silent).
</p>

<p>
The men thrust me rudely into an empty cell.
I sit down on a bench fixed in a corner under the
small, barred window and lean my head against
the wall. I feel neither unhappy nor afraid; only
weary, unspeakably weary; and almost at once I
fall into a deep, dreamless sleep. Never since I
was a child at Otrada have I known such perfect
rest—such utter oblivion poured upon such limitless
weariness.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly my door is opened abruptly and one
of the men enters; he takes me by the arm, and
conducts me back to the large, bare room, where
the elderly official still sits at his desk. And
there, standing before him, I see Elise. She is
weeping bitterly. I see her making those comical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
grimaces which always accompany her tears, as in
Italy cheerful music accompanies a child's funeral.
My mind—like a frightened bat that has flown into
a room and darts hither and thither—flutters and
plunges wildly through all my past life. I think
of my mother, of little Peter, and of Bozevsky; I
remember a pink dress I once wore here in Vienna,
at a reception of the Russian Embassy.... I
think of little Tioka and his days for saying
“No.” ... How far, how far away it all is!
What a gulf of guilt and sorrow have my tottering
footsteps traversed since then.... But now—now
I will climb tremblingly, devoutly, the steep
road that leads back to safety; humbled to my
knees I will pour out my thanks. For Paul Kamarowsky
is saved; he lives and will recover!
</p>

<p>
The man at my side is dragging me roughly
forward. The elderly official at the desk has beckoned
to me, and as I stand before him in a line
with Elise he reads aloud from a sheet of foolscap.
Suddenly I hear the words: “Complicity in the
murder of Count Paul Kamarowsky....”
</p>

<p>
The murder? <i>The murder!</i>
</p>

<p>
Two of the uniformed men hold my arms.
</p>

<p>
“But,” I try to say, with chattering teeth,
“Count Kamarowsky lives ... he will recover.”
</p>

<p>
The man replies, “Count Kamarowsky is dead.”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
I laugh out loud. The car on the switchback
rushes, whirls, plunges—falls with me to destruction.

XLII

<div class="poem">
<p>Like a dream within a dream.—<span class="smcap">Poe.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
It was in the prison infirmary that I first heard
the details of what had passed in the Villa Santa
Maria del Giglio, on that fatal morning of August
the 3rd. As the nursing sister sat beside me,
renewing from time to time the cold bandages
placed on my throbbing forehead, she told me in
low tones the mournful and tragic story. I listened
as if I were listening in a dream to the story
of a dream.
</p>

<p>
“When (she said) at early morning the Venetian
servant-girl heard a knock at the door she
went to open it, and a pale youth stepped quickly
across the threshold. He asked for Count Kamarowsky,
and bade the girl tell him that Nicolas
Naumoff, of Orel, had arrived and desired to see
him. The girl went to her master's door and
knocked. He was awake and had risen. On hearing
her message, he hurried out to meet his friend,
for he loved him like a brother—”
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
(“Ah, sister, I know, I know! He loved him
like a brother!”)
</p>

<p>
“When he saw Naumoff come in he went forward
to meet him with open arms. The young
man raised his hand and fired five shots point blank
into his body. The Count fell to the ground; but
even then he stretched out his arms to the young
man and said: 'My friend, why have you done
this to me? In what way have I ever harmed
you?' The young man, with a cry as if he had
awakened from a dream, flung himself on the
ground at his feet. Then the wounded man
showed him the balcony from which he might
escape, and with fast-ebbing breath forgave him
and bade him farewell.”
</p>

<p>
(“Oh, sister, sister, with fast-ebbing breath he
forgave him and bade him farewell!”)
</p>

<p>
“He was carried to the hospital, and the doctors
wanted to give him chloroform while they probed
the gaping, deep-seated wounds; but he would not
take it. 'Do what you have to do without sending
me to sleep,' he said. 'I shall have plenty of time
to sleep—afterwards.' The doctors groped for
the bullets in the lacerated flesh, and stitched up
the five, deep-seated wounds.... When it was
over he asked for you.”
</p>

<p>
(“Sister, sister, he asked for me!”)
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
“He begged that you might be summoned
quickly, and many telegrams were sent, but you
neither came nor replied.”
</p>

<p>
(“I neither came nor replied!”)
</p>

<p>
“On the third day he was better. He spoke
to those around him, and again he asked for you,
and hoped that you would come. In the hospital
he was in the hands of an old and very famous
surgeon; but alas! as Fate would have it—”
</p>

<p>
(“What? what? As Fate would have it—?”)
</p>

<p>
“As Fate would have it, the mind of this old
and celebrated surgeon suddenly gave way. None
knew that anything was amiss, as he stood that
day at the bedside of the sufferer whom his skill
had saved. He spoke to his assistants in the same
calm, authoritative voice as usual, but he ordered
that <i>the stitches should be taken out of the five
wounds that were just beginning to heal</i>. Those
around him recoiled in amazement. They were
thunderstruck. But he repeated the disastrous
order in the voice of one who is accustomed to
command and to save lives that are in peril.
Then—”
</p>

<p>
(“What then? What then?”)
</p>

<p>
“Then the assistants, doubting their own wisdom,
but not that of the man who had been their
master, obeyed, and reopened the five deep-seated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
wounds which were just beginning to heal. And
again, as Fate would have it—”
</p>

<p>
(Ah, Fate! The ghoul, the vampire Fate!
She who has pursued me since my birth! She who
has caught us and crushed us all in her torturing
grip, splintering us like frail glass bubbles in her
hand! Now she had entered the sick room of
Paul Kamarowsky, had brooded over his bedside,
and in fiendish pleasantry had scourged the old
surgeon's brain with madness, whipping it to
frenzy as a child whips a top, guiding his hand to
tear the injured body and reopen the fast-healing
wounds.)
</p>

<p>
“As Fate would have it, the old surgeon gave
other and still more dreadful orders. Ah, holy
Virgin! how shall the horror be told?... When
the bewildered assistants, aghast at what they had
done, laid the sufferer back on his pillows, the slaying
had been accomplished.”
</p>

<p>
(“The slaying had been accomplished!”)
</p>

<p>
“With his last breath he called upon your
name.”
</p>

<p>
(“With his last breath he called upon my
name!”)

</div>

<p>
If I were to be asked to name the darkest hour
of my dark life, well do I know which of all my
gloomy memories would raise its spectral face.
</p>

<p>
Not the terror-haunted hours of madness and
crime, not the anguish-stricken nights passed at
the bedside of those I loved, not my own life-struggles
with the monsters of disease and dementia,
tearing at the very roots of my life—no,
the darkest hour of my life was that glorious summer
morning in Venice, when I was brought from
the prison of La Giudecca to attend my trial at the
Criminal Court. The sun flung a sparkling net of
diamonds athwart the blue waters of the lagoon,
and the gondola bore me with peaceful splash
of oar over the dancing waters. The gondolier
steadied the swaying skiff at the wave-kissed steps,
and I rose, drawing my veil about me, to disembark.
</p>

<p>
As I placed my foot on the steps—how often before,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
in happier days, had I thus stepped from my
gondola, greeted and smiled upon by the kindly
Venetian idlers!—I lifted my eyes. A crowd had
assembled at the top of the steps and thronged the
piazza. They stood in serried ranks, menacing
and silent, leaving a narrow pathway for me to
pass. I faltered and would have stepped back, but
the carabinieri at my side held my arms and impelled
me forward. At that moment some one in
the crowd—a woman—laughed. As if that sound
had shattered the spell that held them mute, the
mob broke into a tumult of noise, a storm of hisses
and cries, shrieks and jeers, hootings and maledictions,
while, rising above it and more cruel than
all, was the laughter, the strident, mocking laughter
that accompanied my every step and gesture.
</p>

<p>
And there, tall and motionless in the midst of
the laughing, hissing, shrieking mob, stood my
father, his white hair stirring in the breeze, his
eyes—the proud blue O'Rourke eyes—fixed upon
me.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Oh, father, father whose heart I have broken,
in that hour I paid the wages of my sin. Not these
dark years of imprisonment, not the mantle of
ignominy that clothes me with eternal defilement,
not the gloomy solitude in which I see the gradual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
fading of my youth, not the horror of the past, nor
the hopelessness of the future—not these are the
deadliest of my punishments; but the memory of
your white hair in the crowd that hissed its hatred,
and laughed its contempt of your daughter, and
the jeers that greeted you, and the rude hands that
jostled you when you stepped forward and laid
your hand in blessing on my degraded head.

<h2>
EPILOGUE
</h2>

<p>
The verdant landscape of Central Italy swings
past the train that carries me homeward. The
looped vines—like slim green dancers holding
hands—speed backwards as we pass. Far behind
me lies the white prison of Trani; and the memory
of Marie Tarnowska and of her sins and woes
drifts away from me, like some shipwrecked
barque, storm-tossed and sinking, that I have
gazed upon, powerless to help.
</p>

<p>
The long summer day is drawing to its close;
above the Apennines where the sky is lightest the
new moon floats like a little boat of amber on an
opal sea. Like a fragment of a dream the song
returns to my memory, the childish song of which
I have never heard and shall never hear more than
the first two lines:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>When little children sleep, the Virgin Mary</p>
<p>Steps with white feet upon the crescent moon...</p>
</div>

<p>
As the train carries me homeward, back to the
joys of life and love and freedom, back to the
welcome of friends and the safety of a sheltered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
hearth, I think once more of her whom I have left
in the gloom of her prison cell.
</p>

<p>
Soon, very soon, the hour of her release will
strike, and the iron doors that have guarded her
will open wide to let her pass.
</p>

<p>
What then, what then, Marie Tarnowska?
</p>

<p>
Who will await you at the prison gate? Surely
Grief, Scorn, and Hatred will be there. But by
your side I seem to see a guardian spirit, shielding
your drooping head with outstretched wings. It
is the sister of lost Innocence—Repentance; and in
her wake comes the blind singer, Hope.
